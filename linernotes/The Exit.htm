When David Cameron announced his resignation in front of 10 Downing Street, it was a dignified and proper event - except for the end. His wireless microphone was accidentally left on, so all could listen in to his mutterings while he walked back to his residence. He started to hum a tune, some kind of motif. However, as Gabriela Montero pointed out, it was out of tune. Politicians want to be taken seriously, which I did and thus constructed a tuning system based on the former Prime Minister's mutterings. This came out to Equal Temperament with the B and the E tuned a quarter tone, or 50Hz flat. It makes for remarkable scales. What does the future of England hold? Is it imaginable that David would reveal it all while playing his guitar? Yes and yes. The nylon guitar in our case is rather large, so large in fact, that the whole British Empire fits in it.
