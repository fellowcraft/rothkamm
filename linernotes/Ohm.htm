One day we were sitting in company when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure grey clothes, his head covered by black headphones. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. I ask: “What’s up?”. He said: “You speak the truth in actions. There is no separation between word and deed, between faith and life, between church and state. But it goes further to the very truth of being: there is no separation into essence or existence. There is only one and we will all become one. The truth will make all living beings one: either by death or by love. The guiding concept is always your instinct. The place of origin is always your birth, where you are not a tabula rasa, but an intact state. You start intact and then corruption sets in. It is a race against the clock: Your life is the utmost - perfect and longest - the moment you are born. Thus ensues a fight against differentiation and you will die from it. How you engage others does not matter: you can love them or you can hate them. You make the decision, whatever your truth is becomes the truth. Life is lived by the oneness of all: you cannot go wrong, because you are one. There is only one true faith, and that is your faith. You are just a messenger: you communicate foremost to others. Loving others is a way of life. Hating others is a way of life. The best way for you to die is to give your life for the truth. The best way for you to live is to give your love to the truth.” Then he went on his way but I stayed with my company. One of them said to me: “Do you know who this Dude was?” I replied: “He came to you in order to instruct you in matters of politics and religion”.
