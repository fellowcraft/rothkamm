Sometimes you feel that this is end of something. This feels unsettling. You go in many directions at once, you toss and you turn, but there is an undeniable pull to some other place. You are at a dead end. One more step and everything will collapse. No, everything is about to collapse if you don’t step back. What have I been thinking? This just isn’t working, you’re just banging your head up against a wall. The cure to a hangover is another drink until you drink constantly. You are dead, but you don’t know it yet. Your time is up and you’re looking at your former self, the one you thought you could have been. It was an illusion from the start. You should have listened to others that told you not to try, to stay away, be safe. But no, you said, I’ll do this. Many will enter, few will win. You entered and you lost. Again and again. You didn’t even come close, but you kept up the illusion that one bright day in the future you will win. The only thing you got is experience. You got old, but not wise. Every morning you get up. Tend to the things that need tending. All this is about to change. Everything has a beginning, middle and end. You are in End Times.
