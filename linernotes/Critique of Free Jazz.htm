1 Free Jazz is everything that is random.<br>
(We have input, the program, and output.)<br>
<br>
2 What is random, the fact, is the existence of <i>musical</i> facts. <br>
(The input is random within a range, a random choice from a known number of elements.)<br>
 <br>
3 The musical picture of the facts are the <i>notes.</i> <br>
(The program is the advancement of time with each random choice.) <br>
<br>
4 The notes are the <i>significant</i> propositions. <br>
(The notes can be from imperceptible to indefinite. To be significant, they almost always are short or a fraction of short and within a musical range)<br>
 <br>
5 Propositions are musical functions of <i>elementary</i> propositions. <br>
(An elementary proposition is a musical function of itself.) <br>
 <br>
6 The general form of musical functions is: MF = random(lower_limit,higher_limit) <br>
(This is the binary form of propositions, the Bernoulli trial) <br>

7 Whereof one cannot make a note, one must make a <i>rest</i>. <br>
