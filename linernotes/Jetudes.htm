<p><span>Once upon a time all music was made by <em>hand</em>. It was crafted with skills acquired over many years of practice. It served the purpose of a refined environment to the very <strong>few</strong> and very <strong>rich</strong>. It favoured quiet conversation over <em>sublime subjects</em>: Are Time And Space The Conditions For Human Experience? or, Is The Experience Of Time Merely The Effect Of Gravity? or, Why Are We Having Such A Hard Time To Find A Place To Park Around Here? 
</span></p>
<p><span> These times are referred to as the time of salon music. By the time they reached the United States things changed or, shall we say, got contemporary. In May <strong>1865</strong> -- <strong>100</strong> years before I was born in Germany -- American-born Louis Gottschalk was mentioned in a San Francisco newspaper as having &quot;travelled <strong>95,000</strong> miles by rail and given <strong>1,000</strong> concerts&quot;. However, he was forced to leave the United States later that year because of a scandalous affair with a student at the <em>Oakland Female Seminary</em> in, of all places, Oakland, California. He never returned to the United States. </span></p>
<p><span>Admittedly, I also had an affair with a student of a <em>Young Ladies' Seminary</em> in Oakland, California, albeit <strong>131</strong> years later. But as hard as I looked, these really are the only similarities between me and the beloved <strong>19</strong>th century composer of salon music. I never left the United States and married my sweetheart. </span></p>
<p><span>We are also rich, we sit in a salon at the Paris Casino in Las Vegas, we discuss the third of the aforementioned <em>sublime subjects</em> but we only end up at TGI Fridays on a Friday. Luckily for us and all other sophisticated Situationists of the 21st century, I have just the right even-<em>hand</em>ed environment to our one-<em>hand</em>-always-on-the-smart-phone times. </span></p>
<p><span>These are my Jetudes 18, 19 &amp; 20. Studies for the Solo Piano, made up on the spot by <em>hand</em>, then edited to perfection and finally served here as a smooth operator&rsquo;s sonata. Go ahead, have a quiet conversation if any of this has anything to do with what the word <strong>Jazz</strong> originally stood for.</span></p>
