Otto Klemperer, the famed German conductor yet forgotten composer, who was a protégé of Gustav Mahler, fled from the Nazis in <strong>1933</strong>. Settling in California, he became the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. This was not a marriage made in heaven. Klemperer was diagnosed with a brain tumor and operated on which left him partially paralyzed in <strong>1939</strong> and he lost the post of music director. In <strong>1952</strong>, during the Second Red Scare, the United States refused to renew his passport and he returned to Europe. In <strong>1957</strong>, now over <strong>72</strong> years old, he made a record for EMI with the New Philharmonia Orchestra of Beethoven’s Symphony No. <strong>9</strong> at Kingsway Hall, London. The record lasts for <strong>72</strong> minutes.

The album <em>Beethoven No.<strong>9</strong></em> is composed and computed from this record, containing my opus <strong>553</strong> through <strong>556</strong>. 
<br><br>
In the Google compute engine each movement of Klemperer`s EMI recording was shattered randomly into <strong>1,000,000</strong> event bits. Then, these were re-assembled to take up <strong>1</strong> hour according to a uniform random distribution. Each event bits` length is between <strong>4</strong> milliseconds and <strong>2.4</strong> seconds long according to a triangular random distribution but each event bit also has a random stereo panning envelope and a random loudness envelope in the 60dB range, making some bits barley audible. Thusly encrypted, each movement now contains an average of <strong>270</strong> orchestral events bits per second. The <strong>1</strong> hour movements were then cut to match the exact lengths of the Otto Klemperer EMI recording.<br><br> 
<em>Beethoven No.<strong>9</strong></em> is a highly detailed, multi-million process, cryptographic sound ocean from Beethoven's Symphony No. <strong>9</strong>.
