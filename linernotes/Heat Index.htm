<p>According to ready.gov, <i>“heat kills by pushing the human body beyond its limits. In extreme heat and high humidity, evaporation is slowed and the body must work extra had to maintain a normal temperature.”</i> We work just to be normal. I noticed that this is true in LA more than anywhere else. It is just too hot to think about anything, much less say anything. All my rationality has evaporated. All of my perception is dissipating into to a series random events without any cohesion or sense. There is no causality. Time moves forwards and backwards. I’m not getting any younger <i>(ain’t that the truth)</i>, but I’m also not getting older. I’m getting nowhere and seem to have run out of directionality altogether. There is no up or down, wait, there is an up and a down, but they go sideways, left to right, right to left. I’m not in anything and there is no outside. That is all I can’t recall from opus <strong>508</strong> aka “rnd<strong>9</strong>e-<strong>01</strong>_heat_stroke”. File it under <i>Supra Reductionism</i>.</p>
