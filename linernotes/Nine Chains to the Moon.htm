<p>Nine Chains to the Moon is Buckminster Fuller’s first book, originally published in 1938 in New York.</p>
<p>In 2015 I conceptualized a Fluxrecord encompassing 9 works that I produced in New York from 1996-1997, the years I became a Freemason. All 9 were specifically created for or commissioned by a friend who was not a Mason. Thusly, they demonstrate the Royal Art in at least the aspect of hiding things in plain sight.</p><p> Encrypted with musical allegory they are gifts to all friends who know how to shake hands or stir their drinks properly. </p><p>On these 9 from the 90s I practise digital audio composition, drum machine and Disklavier programming, play keyboards, analog synthesizer and the electric guitar.</p><p> Thanks to Raymond Chen, DJ GLOVE, Alfred 23 Harth, Joseph Haydn, Hans Werner Henze, Max Lässer, Henry Mancini, Elliott Sharp, Barbara Gogan and of course Joseph Trump without whom none of these Nine Chains to the Moon would exist.</p><p> I am not giving you the third degree.</p>
