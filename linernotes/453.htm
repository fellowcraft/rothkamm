We are all prostitutes. That is according to Mark Stewart from the Pop Group. We are all immigrants. That is according to Mayor de Blasio from New York. Who am I to disagree with these fine gentlemen? All I do is put 1 + 1 together.  Both can be legal or illegal. Which sums up the activity of mankind. From our origins in East Africa we have come a long way. I, for one, used to have blue eyes and blonde hair. Now, whatever hair is left is definitely not blonde and my eyes, well, I just can’t see good enough anymore to know what the color really is. That never stopped my, or mankind’s, love for the trumpet. First highlight I’m throwing into the ring: the Battle of Jericho. Following God's law of herem, the Israelites took no slaves or plunder but slaughtered every man, woman and child in Jericho. After they blew the trumpet. Recently, Miles Davis and Herb Alpert in the United States of America deviced other uses for it. They made money after they blew the trumpet. Who’s to say which use is worse? I’m just blowing my own horn here.
