Long before Lady Gaga bought his house, a "just another Frank from LA" opionated in an interview: "If you want to be a musician, you just have to realize that nobody is gonna care." To prove him right, the Recording Industry Association of America gave Zappa a "Best Instrumental Rock Album" Grammy for this "Jazz from Hell" record that was produced without any musicians or instruments on a music computer. To be sold in stores it had to carry a sticker that read: "Parental Advisory Explicit Content" and the "Explicit Content" was neither Rock nor Jazz, but Zappa's own brand of complex music made on a $200,000 Synclavier.    

Arthur C. Clarke opionated in "The Lost Worlds of 2001":  "As is clearly stated in the novel (Chapter 16), HAL stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer. However, about once a week some character spots the fact that HAL is one letter ahead of IBM, and promptly assumes that Stanley and I were taking a crack at the estimable institution." The HAL 9000 is a sentient computer (or artificial general intelligence) that controls the systems of the Discovery One spacecraft and interacts with the ship's astronaut crew in both the film and the novel entiteld "2001: A Space Odyssey" and is mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red dot. He is quite the character.

These are the facts and "the world is the totality of facts, not of things", as Wittgenstein opionated. Matter of fact this is what "Jazz from HAL 9000" is: Just a mathematical formula that produces 12 endless streams of complex music fit for a vinyl record. But who is gonna care?
