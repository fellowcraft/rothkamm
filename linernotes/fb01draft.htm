<P CLASS="style2c">Unique yet connected to the tradition of classic electronic music, <SPAN CLASS="style2c"><strong>rothkamm</strong></SPAN>'s <em>FB01 </em> sports an astonishing variety of unusual geometries and movements in aural space. A very musical and starkly beautiful combination of pop song sensibilities,  BBC Radiophonic Workshop music, the Cologne WDR studios in the 1950's, and the Hollywood Science Fiction soundtracks from the 1960's, but all as if re-imagined through pure mathematics.</P>
<P CLASS="style2c"><strong>rothkamm</strong>'s <em>FB01</em> defines the electronic music of supermodernism. Recorded  between 2002 and 2003 in Hollywood with the miracle of stereophonic sound to make full use of the left, right and phantom channel,<em> FB01 </em>brings to life <strong> rothkamm</strong>'s experimental stochastic architectures with the crowd-pleasing sleight of "head music".

Despite those elabortate and complex setup of the IFORMM data-processing instrument rothkamm's method of composition is as stated in the enclosed manifesto &quot;free improvisation that free from free improvisation&quot; , which means that rothkamm  records only at night when he is almost asleep. &quot;It takes a lot of pratice to get to point where you can play without thinking or intuitively, which I guess is same with mastery of every instrument&quot;, In months of preparation the system becomes finally stable enough that you I can move to any point in the sonic spectrum without having to do that analysis of the procedure involved. So when I'm very tired you can reach a state semi-consicousness, a state of trance, transcendal of what the sleep researchers call &quot;stage 1&quot; In this state I is outside of time, with is the same as when you do traditional composition, ie. you can go to any place in the timeline and add or edit events. In this s.c.s state once does this so to speak beforehandm which means when you're really in the &quot;zone&quot; you do not make mistakes, but merely play all notes as if dictated by devine providence, or you are expressing the pure idea of the piece. So in a way this is a bit like a seance, but only the results is pure music. My ideas about this have a lot to do with stages I've reached while dancing on X..psychedilic...electronic music..[tangerine dream] there is the whole myth about recording an album while on LSD. However I learned that you can not capture a transcendal stage while you are in it, and it is impossible if the stage is not nduced  by your own body-cemistry but by outside chemical agents, like drugs, because the coverning relationship between body and consicous is too altered. There is a disconnect between between you and your body, so only the subconscious action are still accurate, breathing being the obivious example. So in essence semi-sleep allows you to reach the stage where you can still retain the ability to subconsiously control your motor actions, so I will be able to accuratly express what the &quot;transcendtal state&quot; tells me to express, folllow thru with an idea. All pieces have set up beforehand to be played by a 4-6 piece band, with the distinction that all the instruments are the same and played by me, which is very similar to the idea of an orchestral string section and string quartett, as it is difficult to clearly seperate the instruments becaue they are the same. Interaction with your own clones. </p>

<p class="style2c">When I look at your new album and website, two words  words spring to mind: <STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG> and <EM>FB01</EM>. So let me ask you a two basic questions. what is rothkamm? </p>
<p class="style2c">rothkamm is the last portion of the full qualified domain name Rothkamm.com. From the summer of 2003 until 2005 I have used this alias as my artist name, adding more confusion to an already strained history of 8 pseudomyms so far. About half are exerpts or variations on the name as it shows up on my &quot;Geburtsregister&quot; the german birthcitificate which states that the &quot;surname of the child&quot; is Rothkamm, and the &quot;christian names of the child&quot; are Frank Holger. </p>
<p class="style2c">.. and what is FB01?</p>
<p class="style2c">FB01 is the aconym Yamaha gave to its 1986 sound module, although nobody know what the B stands for. It is also the concept and name of my new album, which is all made with the FB01. In the history of digital synthesizers, the Yamaha FB-01 was one of the first commercial digital synthesizers without a keyboard, basically sold as a library of 336 instruments, which was enourmous for the time.  In 2004 I actually aquired a signed and authographed FB01 from Buck Dharma of Blue Oeyster Cult fame, with all the factory presets fully intact, so they were. </p>
<p class="style2c">Giving that the FB01 is vintage technology, why d </p>
<p class="style2c">What makes the FB01 so enigmatic is that you need an extensive knowledge of Frequency Modulation and SystemExclusive programming to be able to modify the library sounds. The FB01 has one the advanced Ron Kuivila and George Lewis. </p>
<p class="style2c">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2c">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2c">A nod to the first pioneers of electronic music, notably the "Forbidden Planet" work of <strong><strong>Carlos & Bebe Barron</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Vladimir</strong> Ussachevsky</strong>'s signal generator experiments, pre-&quot;Gesang der J&uuml;nglinge&quot;  <STRONG>Karl-Heinz Stockhausen</STRONG>, and the electronic serialism of <strong><strong>Herbert</strong> Eimert</strong> and <strong><strong>Franco</strong> Evangelisti</strong> that emerged in the early 1950s from the WDR studios in Cologne. <strong>rothkamm</strong>'s aesthetic harvests the utopian energy of these modernists to form a super-modernism. Not unlike <strong><strong>Raymond Scott</strong></strong>'s 1958 modifications of a Theremin, which led to his 'Clavivox' synthesizer, <strong>rothkamm</strong>'s 2002 'IFORMM' takes a commercial sound module and transforms it into a enigmatic new form of a sound-sculpting instrument. </p>
