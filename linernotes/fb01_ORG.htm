<P CLASS="style2c">Unique yet connected to the tradition of classic electronic music, <SPAN CLASS="style2c"><strong>rothkamm</strong></SPAN>'s <em>FB01 </em> sports an astonishing variety of unusual geometries and movements in aural space. A very musical and starkly beautiful combination of pop sensibilities,  BBC Radiophonic Workshop music, the Cologne WDR studios in the 1950's, and the Hollywood Science Fiction soundtracks from the 1960's, but all as if re-imagined through pure mathematics.</P>
<P CLASS="style2c"><em>FB01 </em>brings to life <strong> rothkamm</strong>'s  vision of a supermodern  architecture of electronic music with a crowd-pleasing sleight of "head music". Over 6 aptly titled tracks psycho-cybernetic sounds  speaker-pan in hazily melodic and nebulous shapes like transcendental audio that is  experienced <EM>through</EM> the listener.</P>
<P CLASS="style2c"><strong>rothkamm</strong>'s <EM>FBO1</EM> is music from mathematics played by a human, pure electronic music synthesized via frequency modulation on sine waves, the most fundamental building blocks of sound. A nod to the first pioneers of <EM>&quot;</EM>elektronische Musik&quot;, notably the <EM>Forbidden Planet</EM> soundtrack of<STRONG> Carlos & Bebe Barron</STRONG>, <STRONG>Vladimir Ussachevsky</STRONG>'s <EM>Metamorphosis</EM>, and the electronic serialism of <STRONG>Herbert Eimert</STRONG>'s<EM> Glockenspiel </EM>and <STRONG>Franco Evangelisti</STRONG>'s <EM>Incontri di fasce sonore</EM>.<EM> </EM> </P>
<P CLASS="style2c"><EM>FB01</EM> is connected to the obscure realm of modernism: Like <STRONG>Raymond Scott</STRONG>'s 1958 modifications of a Theremin, which led to his 'CLAVIVOX' synthesizer,  <STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG> takes an enigmatic keyboard-less sound module (the Yamaha FB-01) and transforms it into his 'IFORMM' data processing instrument.</P>
<p class="style2c"><STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG>'s <EM>FB01</EM> defines the electronic music of supermodernism. Recorded between 2002 and 2003 in Hollywood with the miracle of stereophonic sound to make full use of the left, right and phantom channel, this first album of <STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG>'s 21st century works comes as a conceptual limited-edition<STRONG> CD</STRONG> with manifesto and extensive liner notes, shrink-wrapped.</p>
