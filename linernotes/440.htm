When it rains, it pours. When it doesn’t rain, it is sunny most of the
time. Otherwise it will be cloudy. These were the wise words an old monk
once told me on a mountain top in Greece, when I left him on a drizzly
kind of day. On my way down the mountain, with my clothes neither dry
nor wet, I pondered his words and my fate. It doesn’t pour, that is all
I could think of. But the man is not a meteorologist. On the other hand,
the weather anchors on TV never get fired, no matter what they fail to
predict. Remember this as you go forth and stumble through the river of
life.
