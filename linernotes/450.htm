I was sitting on the sofa watching TV when all of a sudden I felt a sharp pain in my back. I sat up and tried to stretch, but was only able to do so under a great amount of pain. I still made it to the bed and moved myself into a position where I felt  the least amount of pain. I tried, but could not really sleep all night. In the morning I got up, but then fell over onto the bed with my legs still on the floor. That is where I stopped. If I moved only a little bit, I got dizzy and thought I was going to faint from the pain. Nina called our nurse, who suggested to call an ambulance to get me to the emergency room. But they had to get me on a stretcher first. This was so painful that I thought it must be the devil’s work. I lay on the stretcher in the ambulance as we rushed to the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. Every little move of the ambulance was torture. The siren weren’t even on. Once we arrived at the ER, I was put in a queue of patients and stared at the ceiling, unable to move and hoping the pain would end. The nurse, and then the doctor, were really nice. But of course, I had to somehow roll on my back so they could examine the source of all evil. Nothing physical could be found, so they diagnosed a muscle spasm and gave me valium. That did nothing. Then morphine. That also did nothing. By now I was starting to wonder how much longer I would be able to endure this. Full of drugs, my sense of time and place started to fall apart. Then the doctor did a local novocaine injection into the devilish center of the pain. This finally worked. I could at least move a little bit. “We fixed you”, the doctor said. But we had to act fast, before the anesthetic wore off. So Nina got the car while I slowly worked my way out of the ER. I managed to endure the ride back in the car to our house and went right back to bed. At the ER they gave me a barrage of hardcore painkillers to take, as they expected that my condition will only improve slowly over time. So, now fully drugged up, I lay in bed with my head high. I only stayed in one position and did not move. That is when the devil showed up on my bed. He played the violin and I thought it is the greatest thing I had ever heard. Considering it came from a devil playing the violin like a wanna-be-Paganini, it really wasn’t all that bad. If I could just remember everything, but probably not. I can only remember shapes, and it is, wait, it was all of a sudden dark outside with Nina sleeping next me. As I always wake up every night several times, I tried to fall back asleep, playing the Devil’s music in my head, and luckily I managed to doze off. For the next weeks I slowly got back to walking and sitting with less and less pain. As soon as I could sit in front my master keyboard, I played and recorded the “Advocatus Diaboli” over a period of 4 days. Spirit communication with the Devil has its difficulties, but I deem the results as fairly accurate. If you’d like to play the Devil’s advocate you could say that this is all just improvised music, made up on the spot with no preconceived ideas whatsoever under the influence of painkillers. There is no God or Devil and everything is the effect of neuron firings in the brain. We live, suffer and die for no purpose at all and all order is the result of random permutations. The universe is indifferent, has no morality and this story is derivative and has no meaning. This is what I say: Go to hell.
