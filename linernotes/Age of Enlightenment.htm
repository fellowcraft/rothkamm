It is all a big blur. Where do I begin? When I was 16 I bought a reel-to-reel tape machine from the owner of a record store. I also tried smoking pot but it had no effect because I could not inhale. For a while I did not eat meat, so my Mom, who did all the cooking (thanks Mom!), had to make a separate corner in casserole dishes. But I did like the "burgers" at the local "Imbiss", which were greasy and had piles of mayonnaise on top of onions, but when I ate two of them I got a stomach ache. Later in New York I bought the 2-for-$2.-Big Mac Special at the McDonald's near Times Square. I also got a stomach ache and have not eaten at a McDonald's since, even though most people say their fries are good. I wouldn't know. Nina is a more of a Burger King girl anyway, but we have not eaten there. I was really intrigued by the kinda-German brats at Wienerschnitzel. There is one close to us in L.A., it's on Chrenshaw, next to a Funeral Home. I have no idea what those brats are made of, apparently 100% beef, but the sodium content is 1800mg according to their website, which is nice, the ingredient calculator on the website that is. That is a lot of salt and I'm sure it's not the pristine Magic Salt we found in the middle-of-nowhere in Utah.

What a strange trip it has been. Once it started there was no turning back, but this is true for any door you open. There is no turning back because the arrow of time only moves forward. Though closing the door is the same than opening it, according to Newton's physics; gravity has the notion of time as a sequential order of events but it has no direction. Newton's gravitational laws work both forward and backward in time. So I can reverse myself and I'm still assembled by the same rules: Frank is the same than Knarf. This leads to many sequence errors in common behavior. I open the door, I go through it, I close the door. These 3 events have 3! possible sequential combinations, but only 1 is possible: I cannot first close the door and then open it, as you can not close a closed door. I also cannot open the door, close it and then go through it, because it is closed. Newtonian physics and mathematical combinatorics account for more possibilities than we actually experience.

You are a pain in the neck and you're cramping my style. This is a quote from the movie "Alien from L.A." I have no idea how to cramp somebody's style. But then I also thought when I was 16 that Hollywood was a separate city, and not part of L.A. None of the American movies I watched on German television were in the original language, but they were always dubbed and used many of the same voice actors for different movies. Heidegger also thought that German is the best language for thinking because it so close to ancient Greek. When I hitchhiked to Athens in my teens all the young people there spoke English and they really liked Che Guevara and showed me the Greek translation of Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road'. It looked like Greek to me but I thought this in German.

You slice, but do not peel, potatoes into thick slices, what they call a Julienne cut in France, but thicker. They end up as long rectangular slices in the end. Then you prepare a small amount of a French vinaigrette, but with smoked paprika instead of red wine vinegar. This is extra virgin olive oil, preferably Spanish; salt, preferably kosher, pepper, preferably freshly ground, and smoked paprika, no preference. Coat all the potato slices with this mixture and spread them evenly on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. The slices should not touch each other, but it will not be the end of the world if they do. Off they go into a pre-heated oven of 425 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 218 degrees Celsius, and they stay in there for about the length of the "Age of Enlightenment" record, 32 minutes. Remove them from the oven, separate them from the parchment paper and sprinkle with a bit of coarse salt, preferably from Utah.

Plato thought of this world as a mere shadow play of eternal ideas, but then he got his start by writing down the last conversation of Socrates before his suicide by drinking a mixture of water and "Conium Maculatum", a highly poisonous plant in the carrot family. This, of course, leads directly to the question: What is the eternal idea of a carrot? Although it seems that the question is in fact a koan, there is an answer: If you throw a dice, the probability of getting any number is one divided by the number of sides of the dice. If the dice is the traditional square with 6 sides, the probability is 1/6 or 0.1666... and the 6 will go on forever here. 666, or six hundred threescore and six, "is the number of a man" according to Revelations 13:18. By all accounts the answer is to "know thyself" or "gnothi seauton" which is the Greek: γνῶθι σεαυτὸν. ​
