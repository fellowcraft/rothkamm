What is life in L.A.? There are no flying cars. To get from point A to point B, you ask Google maps. So does just about everyone else. Then you end up like everyone on obscure side streets where only the very rich or the very poor live. They all have intersections that have no traffic lights. So, you get a look from your fellow L.A.ists, they are in their cars, on their phone, either brushing their teeth or wearing sunglasses. They constantly say yes to the question: "An important security upgrade is available, should I download and install?" and there are always upgrades available, except for their car. That has still the same combustion engine, a series of controlled explosions that emit carbon monoxide which is colorless, odorless and tasteless, but highly toxic. But that does not make the traffic go any faster. A lot of homeless people live in cars now, because rents and real estate prices are at historic highs. Usually, I see them decked out in tents close to the freeways. But now they can be right in front of me, in stop and go traffic, just sitting there in the sun emitting carbon monoxide. About 630 people get killed in car accidents each year in L.A. county. I always thought that was more, so being on the road is safe. If we had self-driving cars, there would even be less deaths, and we can live in our cars. I could do some "California Dreaming", take a nap, and I love taking naps. Then wake up, and try a glass of the new Trader Joe's Cabernet Sauvignon. It is incredible for a mass produced wine to be so drinkable and balanced. I also really like TJ's French soft cheese, it's creamy and pairs well. But this is not the reality in 2016. It is not a short ride in a fast machine. You just follow odd instructions from the phone, and I can take directions from a woman, unlike another woman I know. How can this be any faster? There might be a stalled car on the freeway and so somehow sitting here in front of this randomly changing traffic light is way faster. It is amazing that some people live next to the freeway. I mean, they open their living room window, go out on their tiny balcony, and can touch the passing cars with their bare hands. At least they have double-pane windows, or I think they do. Storm windows would be even better. Just imagine the constant hum of the freeway, 24/7/365. It literally never stops. At night it is less dense and at rush-hour it is dense. When is rush-hour? In L.A. there seem to be more hours of rush-hour than any other hour. It's not that people are in a rush, just there are so many people in cars that nobody gets anywhere soon. I could be driving for 81 minutes and I'm still in the L.A. basin before I would enter Indian reservation lands and the Morongo valley casino. Their motto is "Good Times", this is always a time where you make or loose money depending on the outcome of a random generator. What a concept, to spend time simply awaiting the decisions of a dice that is loaded in favor of the casino. Over and over again. Given enough time I will lose all of my money. But in the end I could also win a car and live in it.
