In Greek mythology, Europa was a Phoenician, from today’s Lebanon and she came to Crete when Zeus carried her off across the sea. Zeus apparently looked like a white bull, however that did not stop him from flying over the waters with Europa on his back. More realistically, he just swam with Europa’s clothing acting as a sail of sorts, which turns the white bull into a ship, as Phoenician were known to be great sailors, besides holding the key to a future Europe with their alphabet. This distance between the Beirut airport in Lebanon and Heraklion airport in Crete is 4 hours and 35 minutes today by plane. Given the nature of our mythological  “Bovine Express”, it probably took an hour that seemed like an eternity. Once they arrived in Crete, whose Minoan civilisation was the last matrilineal in ancient Europe, they got busy and Europa had three sons fathered by Zeus: Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon, who became the three judges of the underworld when they died. The foundation of European culture can now be thought of as a “Dreiklang”, a chord with three notes and if we follow the current state of affairs, it is a minor chord, with the octave, the fifth and the minor third as intervals in a diatonic scale. However, there are many ways to tune a scale as there are cultures in Europe and what some regard as in tune others dismiss as out of tune. These microtonal differences give rise then to the many ways a sail stretches under the changing pressures of the wind, a Phoenician sail in the shape of Pythagorean triangle riding on a white bull that allegorizes the Abduction of Europa.
