Welcome to the Club. Let me show you around. It is nothing like you imagined it, is it? As you have so keenly observed we are in an aircraft. But this is no ordinary plane as it’s main purpose is to move in time rather than through space. No, it is not a time machine. The Admirals Club invests in the mind and is not a mechanical device, not in the sense of classical mechanics anyway. But why don’t you have a seat and I’ll make us a cup of tea? This does heighten the sensitivity to things more subtle, perhaps to see through this digital enclosure to which the mind is often confined. The making of tea can be a kind of ceremony, don’t you think? It is certainly a bit drawn out and does not, shall we say, focus on metronomical timing, a clock in the sense of classical mechanics. That’s why we do not have any watches here, only a sextant and a globe. It would be detrimental to our purpose to have anything else. Nobody keeps time here and because of this you will only encounter yourself in the Admirals Club. I see that the tea is working. If you observe closely you’ll come to find us all of one mind. Here in our aircraft moving through time, we’ve always enjoyed this realisation and it kept the conversation flowing. There is a definite forth and back here as our newspapers are made up of characters that can be interpreted in many ways. We enjoy the freedom to actually read whatever we think. This does not mean that the Admirals Club does not have any laws. But these laws are merely the conditions for our freedom to exist. To understand this, we have established the Admirals Club Combo. Yes, it is a demonstration of sorts, but the very purpose of the Admirals Club is to listen to its Combo. We are of one mind but that does not mean that one mind is all. We make mistakes, rarely in regards to time, but most often in regards to space, or what music theorists call harmony. We adore harmony but it has to be the harmony of spheres which is often a matter of finding the right amount of wrong. This is both mentally exhausting and the nature of our composition. Well, how time flies. Just look at the clock, you should arrive at the same time when you left. It was very nice to have you on board and thank you for choosing the Admirals Club Combo. We consider you one of us now.
