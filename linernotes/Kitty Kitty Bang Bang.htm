Kitty Kitty Bang Bang is opus 600 by just another Frank from LA who shuts up and plays his "guitar". It is the result of a long journey that started in his early teens and has taken him far from his origins in "Ernste Musik" (what the Germans call serious art music). Is it possible to understand opus 600 without having the faintest idea how opus 1 through 599 sound like? The answer is yes! Do I have to be on psycho-active drugs or posses a strong desire to join a cult in California to even get a glimpse of what this music can archive? The answer is no, come as you are! But, I cannot even hold a tune in the shower and my sense of timing is so off that I'm always fashionably late. Well, there is really no cure for poor choices in fashion, but when it comes to music, no talent of any kind is required! In this day and age I'm more curious about cryptography. Can Frank's opus 600 help me with that? You have come to right place, because after only one hour, all the powers of random numbers will be engraved onto your very own DNA! I really dig a good fuzz tone, a good organ, a prepared piano and some exotic metal percussion, preferably in some kind a non-western tuning system. Sorry, this ain't no cooking show ... just kidding! Of course you are right on, as you already have the power to see a pattern in chaos! It seems to me that this music represents a snake that chases it's own tail and is therefore very unlikely to stop, ever. You have spoken some wise words here, way beyond your green ears! There is nothing more to teach you. Just one more thing: Your winning numbers are "x 6 1 12 1 13 1 126 4d", which is the title of and key to opus 600 that makes up the whole of Kitty Kitty Bang Bang. Think of it as the rug that ties the room together.
