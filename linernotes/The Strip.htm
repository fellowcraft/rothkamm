<p>Bally`s Las Vegas Hotel and Casino is located on what they call "The Strip" in Las Vegas. This is South Las Vegas Boulevard and all the casinos are on it. Well, almost all casinos. Bally`s hosts the "evening call bar" whose "50 ounce sized drinks satisfy all-day drinking" and is conveniently located on the walkway connecting Bally`s and Paris Las Vegas which is easily identified by its half-size replica of the Eiffel Tower. Well, almost half-size. Bally`s is also the only place to experience "Jubilee", which "maintains the glitz and glamour of a classic Vegas revue complete with topless performers flocked in feathers and rhinestones."</p> 

<p>In July of 2014, after a long, slow drive from Los Angeles, I positioned two Behringer microphones in the window of the hotel room on the 10th floor. I could not open the windows, but, as they were only single pane, an amazing amount of sound leaked through. The distance between the microphones was the distance between the ears on my head. Then I hit "record", sat down on the huge love seat and dozed off.</p> 

<p>When I regained consciousness almost 1 hour of time had passed. I stopped the recording, looked into the mirror to check if I was presentable, left the hotel room and then went about my business in Las Vegas, which consisted of keeping my lovely wife company when she wasn't conferencing.

<p>In October of 2015, at the Lodge of Utopian Science in View Park, Calif., I took 360 random samples from the Las Vegas recording, each with a random length between 1 second and 1 minute and flipped the stereo picture on about half of them, so what came from the left now came from the right and vice-versa. The 360 samples were then randomly re-distributed over the course of 1 hour. Technically, I wrote a program in Python that generated combined orchestra and score files, which executed in Csound. All random distributions were uniform.</p> 

<!--- <p>In January of 2016 I had an experience listening to the final version on headphones while lying down in the dark. Just like I overdosed on something. There I was, and life didn't pass by me, only the same time slices of my reality kept cutting in and out with quantum mechanical uncertainty. Things just started and stopped, but they did not seem to go anywhere: time became space. I was passed out, but not into forgetfulness, but into a multiplied universe of the Now. For the first time I knew things as they were, in and by themselves in the United States of America.</p> --->
