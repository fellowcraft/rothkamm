Our man in Paris. No, he is in Is. Like a Negative Dialektik, if you get my drift. No, a Frankfurt is far from it. But in the 1930s everybody was in Los Angeles. In 2017 nobody is left. It is what it is. Very complex. I tried to make Sauerkraut but it came out as Kimchi or more like a pickled cabbage that you get in Japantown. Full of probiotics. It is very good if you keep things very simple. Salt and cabbage. Honey and soy sauce. Things do have a tendency to get complicated by themselves. Some call this entropy. Ever since Hubble, we know it is increasing. In the whole universe. Luckily, at Whole Foods you can get Sushi rice now. Not quite sure what is going on, but getting Risotto rice from Italy is increasingly difficult in Los Angeles. Well, both are just short grain rices. They are related the same way Sartre is to Adorno, as Paris is to Frankfurt. A lot of nothingness. Apparently the universe is made out of 96% negatives: Dark Energy and Dark Matter. We don’t know what this is. But as my wife, Nina mentioned, I’ve been to the dentist recently. Everybody knows about the experience of a drill hitting the enamel of your tooth and then suddenly the sound is in your brain. That is why I don’t like compression in audio. The highest Hi-Fi is always full frequency, full dynamic range. It is then what it is. Just like drum and bass, matter and antimatter. It should add up to 100%. As it is in Is.
