<p>In 2005 in New York I conceived of an algorithmic and purely electronic work that exists in 3 time zones simultaneously. I would create this live in front of a remote audio-only audience by constantly modulating random streams that were to be fed into the TX7, a keyboard-less version of a vintage 1983 digital synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7.<br>
 <br>
So on the 3rd day of the 3rd month of the year 2005 I recorded 3 tracks at 3 different times in front of 3 internet audiences of 3 humans each in 3 time zones with each performance lasting 33 minutes and 33 seconds. <em>3 Times for 3 Timezones</em> is the superimposition of all 3 as my opus 41 and now my album <em>3 Timeszones</em>. <br>
<br>
In the <a href="press/FluxRecords%5B13%5D.pdf">press release</a> for the project I announced that the dynamic duo of Rojo and Crest will play on the ‘data processing electronic music instrument’ IFORMM, which gives the impression that there are 2 performers. I’m wearing a lot of hats, but this doesn’t add up. At least not to 3.</p>
