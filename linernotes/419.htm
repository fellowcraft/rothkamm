We had an invasion of ants on the afternoon of the party. At first I didn't notice anything, but then they were all marching towards the "carne asada", which was simply waiting on our countertop to be taken to the grill. Carne asada is marinated stripes of beef and the ones they have at our local supermarket are very good. The tamales there are very good too. I moved the meat from the counter and cleaned up. It is amazing how many ants I could wipe away with only a wet paper towel. They kept coming from a tiny hole in the counter backslash and there were a lot of them. I was a little disappointed that all the spiders in our basement did very little to stop them. Once the meat was removed and the countertops cleaned, only a few ants ventured into the kitchen. They seemed lost. Anyhow, music is a natural process and governed by the same laws.
