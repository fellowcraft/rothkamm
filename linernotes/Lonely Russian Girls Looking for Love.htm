There's SF where protagonists have all the ingredients of at least a weakly post-scarcity society but the
#economy is thoroughly late 20th century (Commonwealth Saga, I'm looking at you!). I recently saw a movie
#where robots have taken all the jobs except those of the Exploited Prole and his friends working in the
#dangerous grimy robot factory run by an Evilcorp. My point at which suspension of disbelief fails -
#technology more than 100 years ahead that isn't magic.
Opposed to GMOs, this site is. That title is as deceptive and ugly as the name of the group ? Science and
#Environmental Policy Project? which is a climate-change denier group. People are free to advocate
#whatever they want but don't try to dress it up in science? - especially when it goes against the
#scientific consensus. If the consensus equalled the truth we could all pack up and go home and science
#could be decided by a poll of experts (chosen by?). The scientific consensus on GM food that is on the
#market, is that is as safe as its conventional counterparts. A healthy mix of respect for the scientific
#method and skepticism of received wisdom is better.
Stay tuned for more polar bear updates and learn more about these wonderful beasts as well as what we as
#compassionate and concerned citizens can do to make sure these beauties stay around! The Bear Facts on
#Polar Bears A great site for further information on polar bears - a wonderful resource for those who
#believe strongly in protecting polar bears! And notice the might? - rain might be predicted two weeks
#from now but that doesn't mean it's guaranteed to rain.
It's certainly not implausible - if you have comparatively cheap access to space and relatively fast
#spaceships, then you wouldn't have to have permanent habitats in space anymore than we need them floating
#on the ocean. One of the fundamental Laws of War in space combat would almost certainly be that warships
#have to identify themselves as such with radio transponders, with only space pirates refusing to do so.
#Indeed, I once looked into this and it turns out that there many situations in which objects in space can
#be quite stealthable. I find it grating in both science fiction and fantasy when there's plot-setting
#dissonance.
We have laws and regulations worldwide to allow it; we have regulatory institutions with huge data sets
#and procedural guides to ensure that laws are followed for specific products, and we have a whole built
#up economy around GM crops - namely companies that generate and sell products and consumers (farmers) who
#buy them, and all the associated middlemen.
The AAAS is the world's largest general scientific society, and publisher of the flag-ship journal,
#Science AAAS was founded in 1848, and includes 254 affiliated societies and academies of science, serving
#10 million individuals. The Alliance for Biomedical Research in Europe (BioMed Alliance) is a unique
#initiative representing 21 leading research-oriented medical societies that include more than 400,000
#researchers across Europe. Information for the use only in countries with applicable health authority
#product registrations.
The American inability - or refusal - to learn Russian, let alone other foreign languages, in order to
#conduct their science, combined with the export of an Americanised science system across the Atlantic to
#Anglophone and non-Anglophone countries alike, further propelled the Anglicisation of science. Unlike
#ideology, science changes all the time as new discoveries and new ideas come to light.
That would force you to use other technologies for planet-to-orbit mass freight - or maybe that's not even
#viable and most of the economic intercourse is based on orbital mining, farming, and manufacturing. It
#strikes me as an odd idea for a PhD thesis in this day and age, but then I'm not familiar with the
#selection criteria for thesis topics. Actually, I might do a blog post on this at some point, because
#things get so very messy so very fast in this kind of alt-history.
