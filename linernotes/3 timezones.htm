<p>In <strong>2005</strong> in New York I conceived of an algorithmic and purely electronic work that exists in <strong>3</strong> time zones simultaneously. I would create this live in front of a remote audio-only audience.<br>
 <br>
So on the 3rd day of the 3rd month of the year <strong>2005</strong> I recorded <strong>3</strong> tracks at <strong>3</strong> different times in front of <strong>3</strong> internet audiences of <strong>3</strong> humans each in <strong>3</strong> time zones with each performance lasting <strong>33</strong> minutes and <strong>33</strong> seconds. <em><strong>3</strong> Times for <strong>3</strong> Timezones</em> is the superimposition of all <strong>3</strong> as my opus <strong>41</strong> and now my album <em><strong>3</strong> timeszones</em>. <br>
<br>
In the <a href="press/FluxRecords%5B13%5D.pdf">press release</a> for the project I announced that ROJO & CREST will play on the data processing electronic music instrument IFORMM, which gives the impression that there are <strong>2</strong> performers. This doesnâ€™t add up. At least not to <b>3</b>.</p>
