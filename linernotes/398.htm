<p>The early 19th-century mathematician Gauss was a child prodigy. A contested story relates that when he was only eight, he figured out how to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100 in a few seconds. He went on to figure out a great deal more, including Gauss's law, also known as Gauss's flux theorem. In probability theory, the normal distribution is also called the Gaussian. It looks like a bell shaped curve. As I struggled in high school to understand the basics of probability, I was also very fascinated by its history and used it in my compositions at an early age. The Gaussian is fascinating because of the central limit theorem - and I quote here wikipedia - the "central limit theorem (CLT) states that (...) the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables (..) will be approximately normally distributed" ... or will be Gaussian. Of interest here is that the law of large numbers yields the Gaussian distribution: Lots of independent random events will not lead to chaos but rather to regularity, a shape that humans, who count with their fingers, consider to look like a bell. How to develop or trans-mutate order out of chaos (and the reverse) is also the fundamental question in the Royal Arts and the answers is in this very album, titled "Five."
