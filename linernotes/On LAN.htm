<p>In 1982 I replicated Brian Eno’s 3 speaker setup in my room in my parents house in Moers, Germany. I found it worked exactly as described, but only for people who can afford to sit in rather large rooms. As my room was on the smaller side, I put my speakers so close together that they were inches from my ears. Eno states that his setup “opens out the music”. I experienced the opposite. The music closed in and went into my brain. To this day, it is there. In retrospect the earliest encounter of this kind I had was as a child with Mozart while listening too close to my cassette player in the dark. `A little night music` was playing, but I could also hear the mechanical noises of the player itself , as well as the tape hiss. In 2015 my wife and I went to the High Desert outside of Los Angeles to look at open houses. At the end of a dirt road we found an abandoned homestead that had been vandalized and riddled with bullet holes. The US Marines had a base in the same valley. As I entered the building I could at first hear very little, but then the silence became amplified until the sound of what I saw, the desert in the afternoon, became very loud. I heard something from far, far away enter my brain. It stayed there. Like the background radiation of the universe. It took me a while to figure out the computability of these experiences as I  do not believe they encapsulate linear time. Although the neurological basis for these can be explained as my hyperacusis and my ability to perceive sound synaesthetically, the psychological effects have no resolve. What is left then is `On LAN`, the fourth installment of the Nano Series that ends here.</p>
