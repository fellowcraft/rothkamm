The power went out. I was not in the dark. A light shined forth. It was daytime. I shut down the laptop to save on batteries, because who knows when the power will come back on. No internet, no nothing. I dared not to open the fridge either. After a while I started reading the LA magazine. So many successful people, I mean every page filled with furniture this, eating that, driving something and beautiful retro modern houses. Why am I not a celebrity? Let’s go celebrate. I went to the studio and the only thing that was still working was my mid-century modern Acrosonic piano and my battery powered Zoom recorder. The top of the piano was cluttered with memory sticks from ancient laptops, a video projector and tons of tiny screws that belonged to something. Better clear this all off. I have not played the Acrosonic in a while and it sounded “unique”. The tuning had shifted away from equal temperament and most of the octaves were off. Honkey Tonk. Not quite, as I sat down with the tuning wrench and made sure at least all the unisons were ok. Now it became just another microtonal piano from LA. Hah! As I closed my eyes I could feel a restraint on my head, like I’m wearing a pilot’s helmet. Nothing to worry about, as I am a member of the Admirals Club. I opened my eyes, looked at the keyboard and suddenly realized that I’m wearing Thelonious Monk’s helmet. So, I’m restricted to whatever he wants me to play. The power outage has cleared the path to monkhood. This is easy. I love minor seconds, too. They are not mistakes, they are creative material. Of course. Let me be a frank monk. Off I went flying by the seat of my pants. Hours later the power came back on, the helmet disappeared and the noise of all these electrical things reappeared, which usually keep me company. No kidding, for a little while I was Solo Frank.
