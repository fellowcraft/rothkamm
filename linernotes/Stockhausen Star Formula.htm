<p align="center">I had a dream: on the night of February 26, 2013, the late composer <strong>Karlheinz Stockhausen</strong> visited my studio to see if I could materialize one of his works. <br />
  <br />
  He looked around the room somewhat critically.<br />
  "<em>So, Frank</em>",<br />
he asked, while nodding his head, <br />
"<em>how did you pay for all of this?</em>"<br /> 
 I replied proudly:<br />
"<em>I used to be the Senior Systems Analyst for the New York Philharmonic.</em>" <br />
He took a seat and we started to work. I saw all of his diagrams but then I thought, <br />
"<em>I can't hear any sound</em>"<br />
and was worried. <br />
He nodded again and I realized that I could synaesthetically see the sound in the diagrams. <br />
<br />
Then I woke up, staring at a white piece of paper in front of me.</p>
