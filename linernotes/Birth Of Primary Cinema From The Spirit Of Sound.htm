<p CLASS="style2c">Lodge for Utopian Science (Los Angeles), in conjunction with Flux Records, is delighted to announce <em>Birth of Primary Cinema From The Spirit Of Sound</em> (FLX13), a <strong>DVD</strong> with <strong>4to pamphlet</strong> by German-American artist Frank Rothkamm (b.1965). This 3rd chapter of his TETRALOGY opens on  5/4/2010 and will remain current until the release of <em>Amerika</em> in conjunction with Bad Alchemy (Franconia).<br />
  <br />
  <em>Birth of Primary Cinema From The Spirit Of Sound</em> consists of a Digital Video Disc in the appearance of a 1965 film reel, housed in a shrink-wrapped vinyl record-style sleeve. The 4to pamphlet contains 4 pages of text - 3 of which are printed in 3 primary colors  - and a   business card size print tipped in to page 2.

  The content of the DVD (NTSC widescreen - All Regions) is shaped by perception, as well as biographical and probability concepts and presents a choice between <strong>2 films</strong>: <em>Theory</em> or <em>Praxis</em>. In both, the soundtrack is encoded in 5.1 Dolby Surround, but  in <em>Theory </em>it is configured like a 1930s monophonic radio and in <em>Praxis </em>it is akin to a  1970s quadraphonic record.<br />
