Same as it ever was. Some things will never change. Eternal and unchanging. We come and go but it is all the same. Every day is like every other day. The sun always rises in the East. The tides come and go but it is the same ocean. All humans have only one brain. There is only one brain, the rest is done with mirrors. It all remains the same, constantly. It does not matter what I see now, I’m looking at one thing, constantly. There is no progress, nothing ever develops. The beginning, middle and end are illusions. Time is an affliction, it is endured. I go to the middle of nowhere and I’m getting somewhere. I see my own tail wagging: the coccyx is the remnant of a lost tail.
