on the phone with the Count. “You want to convert all cash to
Euros, so you can do a transfer out of the account,” he repeats
wryly. My hands are sweaty. “That is exactly what I’m trying to
do,” I reply, and gaze at the screen to find the exact value for my
holdings in Euros. “You actually have a negative balance in Euros,”
the Count states and I can tell from the tone in his voice that his
eyes have glazed over, “and you’re paying interest on it”. I
desperately look at my positions spreadsheet in the web trader
platform. I have no idea what these numbers actually mean and there
are so many of them. Where are the negative signs? Shouldn’t they
be in red? I dare not to ask these questions. You do not ask the
Count these questions. You’re dealing in potentially millions of
dollars and should know the very basics of Wall Street trading. Show
me the money. The numbers keep moving up and down. Where is the
money? I now actually do ask the Count the question. “It’s right
there in positions under Chinese monkey shit,” he replied. I’m
beginning to hallucinate. There is no such thing and the Count would
not waste time with that. There is probably a bitcoin speculator
waiting on the other line, who is sobbing right now because he can’t
confess to the Count that he wasted all of his mother’s life
savings on a scheme to get rich, to get rich quick.</p>

been through Hell”, he noted and stared at the ground as if to
penetrate metaphysical matter like Nietzsche’s ‘Übermensch,’
the Superman. “So, there is a Heaven,” she replied and put her
book down, got up and made coffee. “Can I use the pods in the
plastic bag?” she asked, unsure if they have been used or not.
“Yes, for every proposition there is a negation, in formal logic at
least,” he spoke as his eyes lifted off the ground towards the
coffee pods. She shook her head, fiddling to get the pod into the
machine they called the Difference Engine and continued: “Freud, by
his own admission, proposed the ‘Es’, the subconscious mind, and
he just fabricated the ‘Über-Ich’, a Super-conscious mind, out
of pure negation of the ‘Es’. Because there is a sub-structure of
the mind known to the pre-clears of Scientology as the reactive mind,
we have – ‘deus ex machina’ as the Greeks said: God from the
machine – the all-in-control ‘Über-Ich’, the third eye of
Freudian analysis.” The coffee machine started blinking a pulsating
red, indicating in machine language that it either encountered a
major error or that the coffee is ready. “I think the coffee is
ready,” he replied in a tone beyond good and evil, beyond any
reasonable doubt, “and there is no such thing as a Super-Ego or
‘Überbau’, as Marx made up the Super-structure out of very thin
German air years before Freud.” She had a sip of the coffee that
was still hot and steaming an infinitesimal bit and went on, “The
Difference Engine does not really a hot coffee make.” He looked at
her: “Indeed, linguistically, here is the dilemma: the ‘Über’
got lost in translation.”</p>

“Music and Sculpture”, a chapter of Oswald Spengler’s seminal
Decline of the West, Spengler emphasizes the ‘Drang ganzer
Zeitalter’, a pressure or force that whole time periods exert, a
force we are inevitably caught up in, swept away as it were, by the
persuasion of time itself, time personified as a character that
shapes individual life according to a ‘Drang’.” Her reply was
appropriately, “I’m hungry, do you want a baby breakfast?” and
she did emphasize the baby portion in her sentence, “So, a soft
boiled egg and what do you want on your toast?” “In Europe eggs
don’t have a soft consistency,” he said, so she said, “That is
because they don’t refrigerate them.” “In the same way, they
don’t put the cheese in the fridge either,” he added. “And
neither do the Europeans circumcise, I wonder if there is a
historical connection between circumcision and refrigeration?”

trauma of things past is the current underdog in German national
politics. As common wisdom has it, this has always been the answer
when nobody thinks and everybody just follows the regime of political
correctness, a spectre that everybody sees but nobody laments. Why
would you think or lament if the ‘res publica’, the root of the
word republic, is always correct like the proverbial party? In
Germany the state is always right. This is reasonably founded on
Hegel’s ‘Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts’, the Elements
of the Philosophy of Right, a mighty tome of spectres and diabolical,
some say dialectical, movements towards a final goal, the ideal state
of things. As practical and animistic the proponents of politics in
Germany are, their outlook is firmly attached towards this utopia.
This is a remarkable feature of German politics: The best of all
possible worlds is a condition rather than an exception. That is why
the critic of populist AfD on the regime of political correctness was
scandalized, and not understood: The notion that at the very center
of utopia is the very reason that such utopia does not exist.”</p>

press the power button on my remote control and the TV turns off.
Suddenly it is quiet and dark in the room. Just a looming afterglow
in my mind and odd voices that appear for the duration of a sentence
and then vanish as soon as I move my head. I’m very tired, tired
indeed, might already be sleeping, but my pillow is still in sitting
mode. Slowly, I move it to the right spot, put my head on it and turn
to the side, looking through the window over a moonlit city. I close
my eyes.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Democracy
is the rule of the majority. It is not the rule of truth of fact, as
in science; or truth in belief, as in religion. It is the rule of
large numbers; all quantity, not quality. It’s is a game of
counting, as in simple addition, perhaps the oldest tool in the
arsenal of the human capacity of abstraction. Every human is a 1.
Historically it took a long time to arrive at this equation. Some
humans claimed they were infinity and therefore encompass every human
that ever lived, and will live in the future. But, as a human their
number is only 1. The number of man is 1. The number of the devil,
the messenger, the savior, the god, the entrepreneur, the banker and
the worker are and have been judged as different and seemingly less
or more than 1. But every human is number 1. Humanity is therefore
established by counting every human. This is both true in science as
in religion. So, democracy is based in Humanism, but is it not the
only Humanism, because the rule of the majority is not the only model
for humans to make decisions. So, the preeminent argument of
democracy is the counting of all humans as equals, as in 1 = 1, or an
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Only because every vote is
counted as 1 vote, the decision is the decision of the majority. The
minority gets nothing, the majority gets everything, even in
irreversible decisions of life or death. The vote of the majority
will and has historically always changed, but it always has been this
binary decision: The choice between 2 outcomes. This is the basis of
all computation. Binary code only has 2 elements: 0 and 1, and every
numerical system can be reduced to binary. The future of democracy is
the counting of every human as 1. Historically not all humans were
counted because they were not recognized as human. The Greeks called
them a barbarian. Numerically, there were humans minus x, where x
equals any number greater than 0 but not greater than 1. They counted
less, to the point that they counted not all. Throughout history
humans have used this formula to justify any decision that is not
democratic as democratic. However, it always was tyranny and always
ended up in humans taking the stand against tyranny, to ascertain
their humanity.</p>

I was”, she gasped for air, “in the morning in the middle of
Venice, trying to find my way to the train station and Google Maps
was on night mode.” “But you did find it, the train station?”
he said worryingly, as he was completely worried about her going all
alone on a trip from one country, where they spoke English to
another, where everything was in Italian, even the manners and the
undying respect towards women. “Yes, I found it, it was just hard
if you have to be somewhere on time. I thought, how many times do I
have to cross this canal, can Google be right?” “Google is always
right” he smirked back, “it used to be that the party is always
right, but now it’s Google.” “But I did find it, this train
station” she shrugged off his remark. He went on, “I had to rely
on an inner sense of direction when I hitch-hiked to Venice many
decades ago. So I mostly ended up walking randomly around Venice,
like an ant. In a labyrinthine city like Venice a random search can
be faster than any systematic approach.” “If Google wouldn’t
have been on night mode, I would have read the screen much better,
but randomly walking around would not have been faster.” “Yes
that is true. All roads lead to Rome. You would have ended up at the
Rome train station. Random searches only work on large data sets
where a binary search would just be too cumbersome and slow.”
“Don’t forget that each random search must be truly random and
independent of all others,” she reminded him of the facts. “It is
just as hard to order the right kind of coffee in Venice, you either
end up with too much milk or tiny portion sizes that are too strong.”
“I would go with an Americano, even here in Germany, I look for
Americano.” “Yeah, you wouldn’t just randomly pick a coffee
now, do you?” she replied which gave him this idea: “There should
be an app that truly, with a uniform random distribution, picks out
entities from any dataset, that will present the truly random as an
alternative to the algorithmically deterministic.” “Why don’t
you finish your mandarin, they are not too sour, really.” He
finished his mandarin, picking randomly a slice off either end, not
thinking about it.</p>

said. Bunte is good. It stands for mixed, a colorful selection of
