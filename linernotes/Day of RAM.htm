<p>LA is mostly endless driving in a car from one place to another that look very similar to each other. Almost all days look identical too. This makes it difficult to remember anything. It is not that events lack distinction or emphasis, it is just that they have no discernible place or time. Everything happens somewhere at some time. All the cars are different, but so many pass by in a short amount of time that you cannot fix significance to any of them. They are disorienting. There is no freeway limited to blue cars, or a street of Benzes and Beamers. Car dealerships are of little help. All the cars there are new. They are even more identical and all the dealerships have the same car it seems. Strip malls do not help either. Their form is undistinguished. It is the content that means anything. That sushi place next to the drugstore. Yes. Even this could be in a lot of places. The sun shines, it does not rain, so the orientation in space and time vanishes into a big blur. Remember that day in the spring, or was it autumn? Everywhere in LA can also stand in for any other place. Nothing of significance happened in almost all of them. Perhaps a shooting occurred, an accident, a burglary. None get a historical maker. Remember all the places we parked? Iâ€™m just lucky enough to find the car in the parking lot.</p>
