Hayashida Hall is located on the island of Manhattan. A few steps from Central Park. A wonderful place, but perhaps the smallest concert hall in New York. But wasn’t it Martin Luther King who said that you shall not judge halls by their size but by the content of their character? If he ever uttered such wise words then our partons of the arts who call Hayashida Hall their home are of the highest character. For one, Yukari Hayashida and Delphi Basilicato, our resident Manhattan power couple in question, have a fine selection of libations and even finer Japanese crackers at the ready for the discerning touring artist, like myself, who prefer the finer things in life, even though he cannot afford them. Look at any concert hall in Manhattan and none can compare to Hayashida Hall. The piano, for starters, is in the kitchen, cleverly installed on top of butcher blocks, that are accustomed to the daily pounding of knives, therefore giving the piano a bounce that you won’t find on any other piano. Hayashida Hall is the only concert hall that is also the kitchen of the marvelous chef of Italian inspired cuisine, Delphi Basilicato. The contact between performer and audience is very intimate. As a matter of fact, the audience sits on a fine futon that is literally one step away from the stage, which is also the kitchen, but I already established that. There is plenty of character here. To add more characters to the hall, a live connection to the island of Guam was established. Guam is actually  3⁄4 the size of Singapore. So I don’t want to hear any size and or character remarks here. It’s big enough and the audience in Guam was big enough as well. No more questions. We were all connected, the island of Manhattan and the island of Guam. I could hear them and feel them and I haven’t felt so connected to an audience in many decades. Thus an oceanic breeze swept over our connected spirits and took us far, far away. Until I accidentally hit the colander with a last passionate run on the piano.
