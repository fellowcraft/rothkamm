<p>In the beginning there is the question of relevance and rapture. It's a deeply personal one. During the disturbing era of the financial collapse of 2008, a film arose as an examination of the time and it arose in spite of it. While the thunderclap signalling the largest decline of real estate values since the Great Depression was reverberating across the world, a friend of contemplation and enigmas sat somewhere in a corner of New York. His fate was to sell his apartment and to make this film. His state of mind was reflective and perplexed, thus simultaneously stressed and carefree. So suffering, he did the math and wrote down his thoughts on Hollywood. This preface (or postscript) is dedicated to the kernel of what would emerge as a wonderful, yet hardly accessible film.  	After a year had passed, he found himself in Los Angeles. He still hadn't erased the question mark he wrote at the end of the word &quot;<em>Hollywood</em>&quot;. Then, in the month of deepest tension, when year-end bonuses were negotiated on Wall Street, he finally started to finish the <strong>BIRTH OF PRIMARY CINEMA FROM THE SPIRIT OF SOUND</strong>. From Sound? Sound and Primary Cinema?  Hollywood and the Sound of Primary Cinema? Hollywood and the artwork of Supermodernism? How can this be? Does Hollywood need Primary Cinema?  What's more… Utopian Science?</p>
<p>What he seized upon is something fearsome and dangerous. It is a problem with horns, not necessarily a whole bull, but at any rate a new problem. He states that it is the problem of science itself, as science is now understood to be problematic and questionable. Thus a utopian science was created only out of personal experiences dwelling on the border of perception, and it was built on the foundation of art, because the problem of science cannot be understood on the basis of science. Perhaps, this is a film for artists with analytical tendencies and a capacity for retrospection; an artist that is full of psychological innovations, secrets and metaphysics. It is the sort of film which is good for &quot;<em>the best people of its time</em>.&quot; For that reason this film should be handled with some consideration and discretion because the work dares not only to look at science through the lens of the artist, but to look at art from the perspective of life. </p>
<p>Let me say this again: it is an impossible film. I call it poorly written, slow moving, childish, obsessed with image, sentimental, uneven in tempo, without any will for logical clarity, very self-confident and distrustful of evidence, even distrustful of the relevance of evidence, like a film for the initiated. It is &quot;<em>music</em>&quot; for those baptized into music, for those that have in common rare and shared art experiences. It is a token of recognition among the blood relatives in art. But it is also a film.  Its effects continue to seek out all of us and tempt us to new pathways and dance floors. At any rate, here speaks a strange voice. People admit this with as much curiosity as aversion: the voice is the disciple of a yet &quot;<em>unknown God,</em>&quot; who momentarily hides in the guise of a learned man, under the heavy and humourless dialectics of the German man. Here is a spirit with alien, even nameless needs; a memory filled with questions, experiences and secrets, where the name Supermodernism is written like a question mark.  Here speaks, so people say with suspicion, a mystical and infuriated soul that stumbles with difficulty into a foreign tongue, uncertain whether it wants to communicate or hide. This &quot;new soul&quot; should have sung, not spoken. Ultimately, there is a problem right here. As before, Hollywood will continue to remain entirely unknown and unknowable as long as we have no answer to the question: &quot;<em>What is Supermodernism?</em>&quot;  This film offers an answer.</p>

<p align="center">It  is about 11 o'clock in the morning <br />
  in  my studio in Los Angeles. </p>
<p align="center">I  look out the window and stare <br />
  at  the Hollywood sign in the distance. </p>
<p align="center">The  phone almost never rings. </p>
<p align="center">If  it does, I pick up and nobody is on the line. <br />
  <br />
  After a while my mind drifts <br />
  and a single thought forms in my head <br />
  and stays there.</p>
<p align="center">As  the rate of information is increasing, <br />
  so is its comprehensibility decreasing. </p>
<p align="center">I  realize that this is especially true for <br />
  motion pictures, <br />
  the first digital art form, because<br />
  they are made of single images<br />
  floating by at the rate of <br />
  24 frames per second. <br />
  <br />
  At this rate, we perceive these images <br />
  as continuous motion. <br />
  <br />
  Because of the high rate of <br />
  images per second, or, <br />
  of  information given per second, <br />
  our brain ­­­–<br />
  or let me use a word from Kant's brain: <br />
  the understanding ­­­– <br />
  can no longer process or understand <br />
  the single image. <br />
  <br />
  The evolution of modern cinema<br />
  in Hollywood has only increased <br />
  the misunderstanding of the single image<br />
  by constantly increasing the rate of <br />
  information per second.</p>
<p align="center">My  eyes drift back to the Hollywood sign.</p>
<p align="center">Motion  pictures are based on an illusion. </p>
<p align="center">Motion  pictures are based on an illusion<br />
  resulting  from the impossibility<br />
  to  understand a single image. </p>
<p align="center">Furthermore,  the rate and the amount <br />
  of  this illusion are on the rise. </p>
<p align="center">More  and more events occur per minute<br />
  and  information on the screen<br />
  increases proportionally<br />
  to  the increase in resolution <br />
  of picture and sound.</p>
<p align="center">Everything  goes up:<br />
  <br />
  The average number <br />
  of  differently colored pixels, <br />
  the amount of things on the screen,<br />
  the number of audible frequencies, <br />
  and the amount of sound events. <br />
  <br />
  This happens both to <br />
  how movies are made,<br />
  and<br />
  what  they are made of.<br />
  <br />
  Hollywood's motion pictures <br />
  are on the verge of becoming black holes. <br />
  <br />
  Everything gets sucked into them, <br />
  but nothing gets out. <br />
  <br />
  Everything starts to pass us by <br />
  but we begin to understand nothing.</p>
<p align="center">I  fly back to New York. <br />
  Later, I take an overnight flight to<br />
  Copenhagen. <br />
  <br />
  It starts fine, food is served early <br />
  and they even have wine and cognac. <br />
  <br />
  I close my eyes and try to sleep, <br />
  but after an hour I give up. <br />
  <br />
  So, I stare out the window <br />
  and watch the morning sun over the clouds.<br />
  <br />
  Suddenly I don't feel well, <br />
  panic sets in, <br />
  and I see the sky falling <br />
  just before I black out. <br />
  <br />
  When I finally return to consciousness, <br />
  I see a single image.<br />
  <br />
  Danish flight attendants <br />
  are leaning over me. <br />
  <br />
  Sound slowly fades back in, <br />
  people are talking to me. <br />
  <br />
  I try to understand what is going on. <br />
  <br />
  This takes me a very long time, <br />
  sounds float by me <br />
  and I relate what I see <br />
  to that what I hear. <br />
  <br />
  I cling to the sound. <br />
  <br />
  For the rest of the flight, <br />
  I'm in the rear of the aircraft <br />
  attached to an oxygen mask. <br />
  <br />
  All I can do is breath <br />
  and prevent reality from falling apart.</p>
<p align="center">The  illusion of Hollywood's cinema<br />
  will  be turned right side up again. <br />
  <br />
  Instead of increasing <br />
  the images per second, <br />
  time will be imploded. <br />
  <br />
  There will be only a few images <br />
  that change in galactic time spans.<br />
  <br />
  The changes will be almost imperceptible<br />
  and  distributed randomly <br />
  like dark energy in the universe.<br />
  <br />
  Thusly  created,<br />
  a  cinema that reaches<br />
  for the outer limits of perception <br />
  will destroy <br />
  the dominant illusion of reality.</p>
<p align="center">Only  if a single image is confronted<br />
  over the course of many minutes,<br />
  the brain, <br />
  the understanding, <br />
  will create changes. <br />
  <br />
  In the simplest form, <br />
  we will look at a different part<br />
  of the minutely changing motion picture.<br />
  <br />
  So a mental process is set in motion<br />
  in us, <br />
  the  opening<br />
  of the psycho-cybernetic dimension. <br />
  <br />
  In an attempt to find meaning <br />
  our auditory perception is heightened <br />
  to compensate for the lack of visual clues. <br />
  <br />
  Sound is primary.</p>
<p align="center">I  continue to breathe <br />
  through the oxygen mask, <br />
  sitting motionless. </p>
<p align="center">At  the dawn of mankind,<br />
  ages  ago in the darkness of night,<br />
  we lived in caves <br />
  and were forced to comprehend<br />
  visual information <br />
  out of the sound environment. <br />
  <br />
  In this way, <br />
  we could discover<br />
  a  dangerous animal. <br />
  <br />
  This is a basic survival instinct. </p>
<p align="center">Our  Primary Cinema is therefore<br />
  to look at a very slow moving image<br />
  in the dark<br />
  while  intently listening to sound.</p>
<p align="center">This  is the original immersive<br />
  surround sound experience <br />
  and therefore <br />
  Primary Cinema is sound,<br />
  that  creates the understanding of images. <br />
  <br />
  Sound is not a soundtrack,<br />
  which  is added to images,<br />
  but  it appears<br />
  that  images arise from sounds.<br />
  <br />
  The  image is born from sound.</p>
<p align="center">Although  in Primary Cinema <br />
  we move backwards in time<br />
  in  search for the single image<br />
  ­­­– the origin of Hollywood's evolution ­­­– <br />
  we  still experience cinema, <br />
  not painting <br />
  or staged photography. <br />
  <br />
  Primary Cinema is comprehended <br />
  as a sequence of images with sound <br />
  which in the end<br />
  constructs its meaning. <br />
  <br />
  It limits change   <br />
  and randomly distributes events<br />
  like  dark energy<br />
  on  a galactic scale,<br />
  but despite its apparent emptiness<br />
  it remains true cinema<br />
  as the marriage of <br />
  projected  images and sound <br />
  in  space and time.<br />
  <br />
  The temporal dimension, <br />
  the inclusion of everything <br />
  that  can be experienced <br />
  in space and time <br />
  provides for the cinematic effect, <br />
  as everything outside of space and time<br />
  remains unknowable.<br />
  <br />
  Like in mathematical Calculus, <br />
  infinity is broken down <br />
  into a series of comprehensible steps. <br />
  Each step is a scene <br />
  and ultimately <br />
  all scenes will make the movie.</p>
<p align="center">In  the very end, <br />
  Primary Cinema happens<br />
  with  great probability<br />
  inside  us,<br />
  changing  the very illusion of<br />
  perception,  understanding, <br />
  and  imagination.</p>
