It was actress Sacheen Littlefeather who took the stage at the 45th Academy Awards in 1973. She did not perform a love dance. She took the award on behalf of Marlon Brando, who was declining the Academy Award for Best Actor which he had won for his performance in ‘The Godfather’. Dressed in an Apache outfit, she reminded everyone how hot Native Americans are. It was none other than Jada Pinkett Smith who wrote to Littlefeather saying that watching her Oscars speech encouraged her to boycott the 88th Academy Awards in 2015. How hot is she and that? In 1832 George Catlin captured with his pen the Bear Dance of the Sioux, who supposedly like to oil their long and glossy locks, as well as the surface of their bodies. That’s hot and totally reminds me of 1991 when I went dancing in San Francisco and all guys took their shirts off. It’s 2 A.M., and I am surround by hot guys. However, times change. If I take my shirt off now, everybody thinks I’m pregnant. The traditions of Native Americans are forgotten unless it is about the economy. So, I retreat in front of an organ from my collection. The same model that Keith Emerson used in the Summer of Love of 1968, the Hammond L-100. I invoke Joseph Smith, the Freemason and founder of the religion of Mormonism. He tells me that the Lamanites were among the principal ancestors of the American Indians. Of course, that is all we need: The Lamanite Love Dances.
