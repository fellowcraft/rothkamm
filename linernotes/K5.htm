<p align="center">K5 as the Fifth State of Matter (2013)</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>K5 is a synthesizer built by the japanese company Kawai in 1987. In their own literature with
  the aptly
  titled &ldquo;<strong>Kawai Owner&rsquo;s Manual</strong>&rdquo; the
  unnamed author salutes our choice of machine by stating,
  &ldquo;<em>Congratulations. You now own one the world&rsquo;s most sophisticated digital musical instruments: the
  Kawai K5 Digital MultiDimension
  Synthesizer.</em> [...] <em>The K5 is an exceptional investment in digital
  synthesis technology. It will give you many years of musical enjoyment</em>.&rdquo; <br />
  <br />
  In these three introductory
  sentences the word &ldquo;<em>digital</em>&rdquo; is featured as many times, giving us a clue to what concept was of great
  significance to the Japanese at that time: <strong>Digitalization</strong>. In metaphysical or conceptual terms it means
  this notion: The continuously infinite world of perception can be represented by a finite series of
  numbers, which in turn can be read by a machine which in turn produces an ideal form of the infinite
  back into the world of perception. <br />
  <br />
  &ldquo;<em>With the K5</em>&rdquo; , the manual exclaims &ldquo;, <em>you can control the relative
  amplitude of up to 126 harmonic sine waves</em>!&rdquo; <br />
  <br />
  I personally in
  1987 West Germany do
  not recall any
  keyboardist who wanted to sit down and manually dial in amplitude values for 126 sine waves instead
  of playing the melody from the <strong>Pet Shop Boys</strong>&rsquo; &ndash; &ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s a Sin</em>&rdquo;. This amount of self sacrifice would indeed
  be a sin, and that might have been the reason why the K5 was a commercial failure not only in
  Germany, but in the whole synthesis investing world. <br />
  <br />
  The K5 uses a rare form of digital synthesis called
  &ldquo;<strong>additive synthesis</strong>&rdquo;. The manual explains this: &ldquo;<em>The &ldquo;purest&rdquo; most basic sound in nature is a sine wave.
  It is a S-shaped
  waveform that is constant in its frequency (pitch) and its amplitude (loudness). Most of
  the sound we hear whether
  from musical instruments or other sources are
  much more complex, of
  course. But if you were to analyze any of these complex sounds, you would find that they are actually
  made up of several sine waves..</em>.&rdquo; This analysis and in
  reverse this
  synthesis of adding many simple
  waves to form a complex waveform is not the invention of Kawaii&rsquo;s engineers but of the, here
  uncredited, French mathematician and physicist <strong>Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier</strong>, who lived from 1768 to
  1830. He is known for the mathematical series that bears his name: the Fourier series that
  decomposes periodic signals into the sum of a set of simple sines. <br />
  <br />
  The idea is quite striking: Fourier
  proposes the existence of some kind of fundamental and indivisible simple matter, a sine wave &ldquo;<em>atom</em>&rdquo;
  or &ldquo;<em>elemen</em>t&rdquo; if you will, that, if added to itself in various proportions ceases to be a collection of
  separate elements but becomes a new entity: a complex matter, a complex signal, a complex
  waveform. Presumably, the sensation of complex continuous reality can now be explained and
  computed as additive synthesis from type identical elements or sinusoids. <br />
  <br />
  Two points are of great
  interest here: identity and sinusoid. In contradiction to the revered Kawaii&rsquo;s Owner&rsquo;s manual, sine
  waves do not exist in &ldquo;<em>nature</em>&rdquo;, even if we are generous and read the 1987&rsquo;s japanese concept of
  &ldquo;<em>nature</em>&rdquo; to mean the world of sense perception, which includes any sound, even man made. Sine
  waves do not exist in nature because perfect circles and perfect straight lines only exist, platonically
  speaking, in the world of ideas, eternally unmovable perfect forms. Reality only partakes in them as
  imperfect copies, as the world of sense perception is corrupted and deceitful but never a true sinusoid.
  So the very element that as a sum makes up all periodic signals is not of this world. Interestingly, the
  synthesis can only succeed if all of the waves are of the same otherworldly
  type. To formulate Fourier
  here via <strong>Plato</strong>: <em>Sums of form identical otherworldly
  waves can produce any complex signal in the world
  of sensation</em>. <br />
  <br />
  For Plato this ideal elemental matter is a triangle, the whole world is literally made of
  identical triangles, in a very additive way. &ldquo;<em>Fire and earth and water and air are bodies,</em>&rdquo; he wrote in his
  book Timeus, &ldquo;<em>and every sort of body possesses solidity, and every solid must necessarily be
  contained in planes; and every plane rectilinear figure is composed of triangles</em>&rdquo;. <br />
  <br />
  Now, Plato ends up
  with a triangle as the most basic element, but Fourier shows mathematically that the end is found in a
  circle, which is the same as The Kawai&rsquo;s Owners Manual concept of the &ldquo;<em>S-shape</em>&rdquo;.
  It describes the
  same perfect circle in motion (as a identical repetition in time). <em>A priori</em>, this gives rise to the notion that
  the K5 is, in method and
  science is nothing but a method a <em>Platonic Machine</em>. Plato warns us in the same Timeus book that , &ldquo;<em>excessive pains and pleasures are justly to be regarded as the greatest diseases to which the soul is liable[..]</em>&rdquo;. This solidifies the notion that the K5 synthesizer is a Platonic Machine because I can personally assure you <em>a posteriori</em> that while working with it you do not experience any pleasure or pain whatsoever, only the numbing sensation of tedious repetition, which is quite sinusoidal. <br />
  <br />
  How Plato got his idea of method, his science, we do not know, but as art historian
  and theorist, <strong>Whitney Davis</strong> writes in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, &ldquo;<em>The tradition of Platos&rsquo;s
  visit to Egypt, as the reader will undoubtedly remember, is a strong one, that is , it has been repeated
  many times</em>&rdquo; This description could also be that of a periodic waveform and henceforth it appears that
  the tradition of Plato&rsquo;s visit to Egypt itself came about via additive synthesis into the minds of Egyptian
  archaeologists everywhere. <br />
  <br />
  How Fourier got this idea of method, his science, we do not know, but we
  do know that he went to Egypt with the first expedition of <strong>Napoleon Bonaparte</strong> in 1798 and was made
  governor of Lower Egypt and secretary of the Institut d'&Eacute;gypte. Lingering there in isolation, his support
  cut off by the British Navy, Fourier contributed several mathematical papers to the Egyptian Institute at
  Cairo which Napoleon founded. We can only speculate how he wandered around in the hot blazing sun
  to look at the triangular shaped pyramids and returned from Egypt in 1801 with many artifacts including
  a transciption of the Rosetta Stone. <br />
  <br />
  How the Kawai engineers got their method, their science, we do
  not know, but in the competitive climate of the mid 1980s two other highend
  synthesizer manufacturers,
  <strong>Kurzweil</strong> and <strong>Synclavier</strong>, were working on additive synthesizers of their own, with only Kurzweil to
  actually name it the K150FS, were FS stands for Fourier Synthesis. But what we do know is that in
  1986 the <strong>Bangles</strong>, who left a great stimulus impression upon the male-dominated
  corporate world,
  released &ldquo;Walk like an Egyptian.&rdquo; We also know this was at a time when <strong>Raymond Kurzweil</strong> was still
  with his company and dealt in discrete mathematics instead of speculative philosophy. Personally, I
  can also attest to the stimulus impression of the Bangles upon me as a young man in Vancouver,
  Canada. We will not speculate any further here, as tempting as it is. </p>
<p> I may remind you however that only
  the mind can perceive a Platonic form. So the promise of a Platonic Machine via Fourier, the promise
  of the Kawai K5 digital multidimension
  synthesizer is that <em>any complex, worldly signal can be created
  by summing up in different proportions one simple ideal platonic form, which is otherworldly</em>.
  This
  includes the creation of signals that are either inbetween
  and closer to the Platonic forms or are on the
  very border of categories, on the border of sensations, or both. <br />
  <br />
  The perception of sound as an extra
  auditory, perhaps even visual, substance is not new. We constantly see and hear therefore making it
  difficult to separate one sensation from the other. For the human consciousness there literally is no
  picture without a sound and no sound without a picture. <em>We can never eliminate sense perception, we
  can only minimize it</em>. Many experiments in psychophysics
  have shown that auditory perception is
  always relative and therefore if, as in an aeonic chamber, any external sound stimulus is absent, we
  perceive auditory signals like a &ldquo;<em>ringing in the ears</em>&rdquo; or tinnitus. The same holds true for visual
  perception as anyone who has ever closed their eyes can attest to. You don&rsquo;t see nothing. The border
  between perceptions are not as clear cut as the 4 states of matter in physics. But what are these border
  sensations? <br />
  <br />
  It is quite surprising that among the famous states of matter, that is solid, liquid and gas there
  is one state of matter called plasma. &ldquo;<em>Unlike gases</em>&rdquo; wikipedia tells us, &ldquo;<em>plasmas are electrically
  conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic
  forces. [...] Plasma is the most common form of visible matter in the universe.</em>&rdquo; This counterintuitive
  notion is quite interesting, in our worldly perception on this planet Plasma was definitely the rare
  occurrence until the age of electricity.. Lightning and the sun were the only common sensations of
  Plasma and both were associated with deities. in particular in ancient Egytp the sun was <strong>Ra</strong>, quite
  literally an otherwordly
  God. I would like to point out the obvious: To the human perception the sun&rsquo;s
  shape is never changing and is perfectly round, has no edges and as a circle has no beginning or end.
  Not perfectly sinusoidal, but perhaps as close as we going to get in this corrupted world. <br />
  <br />
  As the 4
  famous states of matter solid,
  liquid, gas &amp; plasma were
  always known even in antiquity, a
  continued search has been going on for the account of border sensations, a search for the unknown, a
  <em>search for the 5th element</em>. This is a rare pursuit outside the world of physics, to perceive unknowns,
  which the wisdom of any given age could not reduce to the 4 elements, to the 4 states of matter. The
  pursuit has a long tradition in the regions of Europe where I was born, but certainly not only there. In the
  German language of the 14th century it was called the &ldquo;<em>K&ouml;nigliche Kunst</em>&rdquo;, which literally translates to the
  King&rsquo;s Art, but it is known in common English as the Royal Art. As the original Germanic symbol, the
  emblem for it would be K5. Just as in the Kawai K5. If this isn&rsquo;t a coincidence of the greatest
  magnitude, I don&rsquo;t know what else could be, but I do know one trick I learned from the Freemasons: <em>The
  best way to hide a secret is in plain sight</em>. <br />
  <br />
  This &ldquo;<em>Königliche Kunst der F&uuml;nften Materie</em>&rdquo;, Royal Art of the
  5th matter or here K5 for short, perhaps alludes to the fact that the pursuit of something so elusive and
  rare as the 5th state of matter could only be accomplished by Royalty. At least this might be the opinion
  of <strong>Lord Grantham</strong> in Downton Abbey. It hides the word King under the umbrella of hereditary Royalty.
  The original meaning of the word king, so wikipedia&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Royal and noble ranks</em>&rdquo; tells us, is from the
  Germanic &quot;<em>kuningaz, roughly meaning &quot;son of the people.&quot;</em> You do not even have to be the King of
  Kings, just plain King, son of people will do. <br />
  <br />
  Here I can only hint at 5 examples of the Royal Art, the
  search for the perception of the unknown, the 5th state of matter, the &ldquo;<em>K&ouml;nigliche Kunst</em>&rdquo;. In the context
  of my 33 minute and 33 second electronic music fittingly also called K5 and
  made up, of course, from
  additive synthesis with multiple identical copies of the Kawai&rsquo; K5 synthesizer you
  could call these
  examples the &ldquo;<em>song titles</em>&rdquo;. I call them singles, as many singles make up a Multiple. <br />
  <br />
  Historically and
  chronologically they appear as follows: <br />
  <br />
  Single Number 1: <strong>Ancient Mariners concerning the Egytpian
  Nefart&eacute;, the solar boat</strong>. In ancient Egyt, the unknown authors of wikia.com write, &ldquo;<em>The Passion of Osiris
  was reenacted
  at all of his temples during his annual festivals. On a stele at Abydos erected in the 12th
  Dynasty by IKherNefert,
  a priest of Osiris during the reign of Usertsen III ([..]about 1875 BC) we find
  the principal scenes of the mysterydrama
  depicted [...]. In the first scene, Osiris is slain, no one
  knowing what happened to his body, and the onlookers weep and mourn [...],. Isis and Nepthys then
  recover the remnants and return to the temple. In the second scene, Thoth, Horus and Isis revive Osiris
  in the [hidden] sanctuary. [...] Then Osiris emerges, to much rejoicing. Horus then places Osiris in a
  solar boat, the Nefart&eacute;, to proceed directly to the eternal regions, known as the &ldquo;coming forth by day&rdquo;
  mentioned so often in the Book of the Dead.[...]</em>&rdquo; <br />
  <br />
  Single Number 2. <strong>Dead Metal concerning the early
  alchemist&rsquo;s Prima Materia, the First Matter</strong>. In the Golden Tract by the selfproclaimed
  &ldquo;<em>Anonymous
  German Philosopher</em>&rdquo;, it reads: &ldquo;<em>As concerns the Matter, it is one and contains within itself all that is
  needed. Out of it the artist creates whatever he wants. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;birth is in the sand&rdquo;[...] as the philosopher
  Anastratus says in &ldquo;The Crowd&rdquo;:&rdquo;Nothing is more precious than the red sand of the sea&#894; it is the distilled
  moisture of the Moon joined to the light of the Sun, and congealed.&rdquo;[...] Nature is satisfied with one
  thing, and he who does not know it is lost</em>&rdquo; In &ldquo;<em>An open Entrance to the closed Palace of the King</em>&rdquo; yet
  another &ldquo;<em>anonymous Sage and Lover of the Truth&rdquo;</em> writes in 1645 &ldquo;<em>Whoever wishes to possess this
  secret Golden Fleece, which has virtue to transmute metals into gold, should know that our Stone is
  nothing but gold digested to the highest degree of purity and subtle fixation to which it be brought by
  Nature the highest effort of Art</em>&rdquo;. <br />
  <br />
  Single Number 3.<strong> Tuba Pacifica concerning Albert Einstein&rsquo;s Ether</strong>.
  wikipedia knows: &ldquo;<em>The hertz (symbol Hz) is the SI unit of frequency defined as the number of cycles per
  second of a periodic phenomenon. One of its most common uses is the description of the sine wave[...]
  <strong>Heinrich Rudolf Hertz</strong> [...] was the first to conclusively prove the existence of electromagnetic waves by
  engineering instruments to transmit and receive radio pulses[...].</em>&rdquo; In Ether and the Theory of Relativity,
  physicist Albert Einstein confronts Hertz&rsquo;s notion of the Ether: &ldquo;<em>[...] dualism still confronts us in
  unextenuated form in the theory of Hertz, where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities,
  kinetic energy, and mechanical pressures, but also as the bearer of electromagnetic fields. [...] The
  ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from ordinary matter [...]</em>&rdquo; <br />
  <br />
  Single Number 4. <strong>Spirit Level
  concerning the Engram</strong>. German zoologist and evolutionary biologist <strong>Richard Semon</strong> coined the term
  engram in 1904 and defined it as a &quot;<em>stimulus impression</em>&rdquo;. He proposed a psychophysiological
  parallelism according to which every psychological state corresponds to alterations in the nerves. [..]
  Semon experimented with phonography, that is the recording of sounds, to explain the uneven
  distribution and revival of engrams. <br />
  <br />
  Single Number 5.<strong> Threshold Magnitude concerning The Edge of the
  Unknown</strong>. Author and spiritualist <strong>Arthur Conan Doyle</strong>&rsquo;s was friends for a time with <strong>Harry Houdini</strong>,
  magician and a member of the Cecilia Lodge of Freemasons in New York. Doyle became convinced
  that Houdini had extrasensual
  perception and claimed in his book The Edge of the Unknown (1930)
  &ldquo;<em>[Houdini] told me that a voice which was independent of his own reason or judgment told him what to
  do and how to do it. So long as he obeyed the voice he was assured safety. &quot;It all comes as easy as
  stepping off a log,&quot; said he to me, &quot;but I have to wait for the voice. You stand there before a jump,
  swallowing the yellow stuff that every man has in him. Then at last you hear the voice and you jump.
  Once I jumped on my own and I nearly broke my neck.</em>&quot;&rdquo; <br />
  <br />
  In the end I can only personally vouch for
  Houdini as I was a Master Mason in good standing at Houdini&rsquo;s lodge at the time I composed K5 in
  2004 in Hollywood and New York. <br />
  <br />
  To conclude in Plato&rsquo;s words: &ldquo; <em>We may now say that our discourse
  about the nature of the universe has an end</em>&rdquo;, but the unknown author of the revered K5 Owner&rsquo;s Manual
  will undoubtedly add to this, to sum it all up: &ldquo;<em>Now that you&rsquo;ve been introduced to the all the K5&rsquo;s
  features and controls, let&rsquo;s take a look at some of them in action</em>&rdquo;</p>
