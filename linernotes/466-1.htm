Ivanka Trump is great 
A woman with real character and class
In all the places there she goes 
Appreciate your use of Twitter 
To keep us informed 
And maintain media transparency
Then celebrate 
Martin Luther King Day 
And all of the wonderful things he stood for

Celebrate Martin Luther King Day 
And all of the many things he stood for
So much worse just look at Syria
Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes 
Not good 
Was this the leaker of the Fake News?
NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night 
Live is the wurst on NBC.
