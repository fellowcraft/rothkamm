Canon is compositional technique. You play the same melody on different instruments but not at the same time. A leader is chosen called ‘dux’. Dux starts playing the melody. Then other instruments called ‘comes’ join, each at one time interval later than the preceding one. If the ‘comes’ strictly imitate the ‘dux’, the canon is also called a round. It’s the simplest form and the most intoxicating. Here are 2 of these: one from the ‘West’ and the other from the ‘East’. To give a good example, drawn from real life: I go to the little known ‘Borges’ bar here in LA and I expect 3 friends will join me later. I give the waiter the following order: Get me a drink and keep on giving me refills. Do the same for each of my 3 friends, they will arrive in a few seconds and each will arrive the same amount of seconds later than the other. The waiter is delighted, once I gave him enough money. My friends are really good sports, they take the same amount of time to drink their drinks than I do. Do you get the picture? Cannonball!
