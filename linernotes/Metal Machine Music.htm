<p>In 1964, a 22 year old Lou Reed moved to New York City and began working as an in-house songwriter for Pickwick Records to pen hit songs. 11 years later RCA records released his seminal "Metal Machine Music" as a double LP. It was the follow up to "Lou Reed Live" which had reaffirmed his status as a bestselling recording artist. It seems obvious, but he knew a thing or two about producing records that hit upon the imagination of large amounts of customers of the record producing industry.
