An unidentified object from outer space reaches earth which seeds a storm that eventually ends all observations of it. Conceptually, 'For Microphone' is about melancholy and entropy.  The sound picked up by a microphone without a windscreen is a rumble which eventually overtakes the normal recording of the wind. This resulting counterpoint is an 'accidental' process that occurred on Christmas day, hence the metaphysical implications of 'For Microphone' , which point to its separate 'substance', 'For Synthesizer'.
