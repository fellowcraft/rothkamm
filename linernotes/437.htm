Life is full of surprises. I wanted to watch the SNL skit WEEKEND UPDATE: THE GIRL YOU WISH YOU HADN'T… ON CHRISTMAS online, but had to sit through a “Viagra Single Packs” commercial first. Here was a surprise: The soundtrack sounded exactly like my “Panda Express” soundtrack. Isn’t this pentatonic? Check this, here is a fact: The giant panda’s diet is 99% bamboo. But it has retained the digestive system of its carnivore ancestry and is therefore unable to digest cellulose, the main constituent of bamboo. Pandas solve this problem by rapidly passing prodigious quantities of the grass through their digestive tracts on a daily basis. As much as 16 out of every 24 hours is spent feeding, and elimination of wastes occurs up to 50 times per day. Think about it. Welcome to America.
