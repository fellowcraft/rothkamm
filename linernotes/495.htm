A long, long, long time ago <BR />
Nothing seemed out of ordinary. <BR /> 
The Queen still reigned supreme <BR />
As all mothers do <BR />
From a distance far, far, far removed <BR />
From the love of the boy <BR />
Heir to the throne <BR>
Who wanted nothing more <BR />
Than the best of mother <BR />
Because she will destroy <BR />
Everything that seeks to kill him. <BR /> 
Alas, as the boy had no powers <BR />
To mend this wound in his heart <BR />
He invented a kite. <BR />
The boy spoke to the wind <BR />
That blew through all valleys <BR /> 
With little regard for silence. <BR />
“I want to get away.” <BR />
The boy asked. <BR />
“Just listen to me” <BR />
The wind answered. <BR />
The boy listened for three days <BR />
Then he disappeared. <BR />
