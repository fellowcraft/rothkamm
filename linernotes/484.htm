20th century avant-garde star Karlheinz Stockhausen quotes the 19th century mystic Jakob Lorber in the liner notes to his 1980 Double Album ‘Sirius’. The last four words of the quote are: ”beherrschen die ganze Unendlichkeit”, or “rule over all of infinity”. Now, in the 21st century we have learned, and I quote here from the motion picture “Toy Story”, to go “to Infinity and Beyond”. Is this even possible? Yes. Because we no longer rule out anything. Especially if we go past an event horizon into a black hole. We won’t know what the rules are. So let’s a take a single oscillator semi-modular analog synthesizer, the Roland System 100 Model 102 and connect it with an analog sequencer, the Roland System 100 Model 104. Are you ready for your trip? All you have to remember is to virtually flip the virtual vinyl record over at the end of each side of this Virtual Vinyl Double Album. Now, space fans, all system are GO: We’re spinning at a virtual 33.3 rotations per minute and launching into ‘Orbits’.
