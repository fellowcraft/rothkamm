What? 
-----
[+] Join the triphony revolution! 

In rothkamm™'s 3rd installment of FB02 you will be taken to a secret rooftop stage 
located between heaven and earth where discreet mathematical microtonal music is 
calculated to interact with the environment. 

Sounds complex? It is, but as easy as watching TV! 

Instead of staring at the tube, you will be outside and experiencing a 360-degree 
view of the light changing while the sun sets on the Lower East Side. 

The narrative is the architecture of New York City itself. 

Instead of simple underscores, a complex 100% electronic music space drama designed 
for future human beings will be projected from above and mixed with the urban sounds 
from below. Lecture and Q&A follows. Don't miss. [+]
