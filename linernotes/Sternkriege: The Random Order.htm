<p>On Monday, December 28th of the year 2015 A.D. I went to the 11 A.M. screening of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” in Lakewood, Colorado. The movie theater had high ceilings and many seats were empty. I positioned a Zoom H2n stereo microphone on the seat next to me which was in the center of the room, waited until all the commercials and previews were over and then recorded everything that happened for the next 2 hours and 14 minutes. Now, with a cryptographically strong random algorithm I take 33,333 samples from this recording, each between 0.1 and 8 seconds long but with a triangular random distribution that favors shorter durations. These vector events, filled with movie samples, are then randomly placed within 1 hour of time; however in about 1/3 of these events the direction in time is reversed - these are played back backwards. All events are randomly remapped in loudness; some are now barley audible and some are at maximum volume, making it statistically possible for originally very soft samples to be heard clearly. Additionally, all 33,333 vector events are moved randomly in stereophonic space, so they range from panning widely to hovering in one position. On average, about 10 vector events start every second over the course of the hour. In the end the  “artificial intelligence” computer program that created all this is named “sw.b1.py.5” and the album is titled “Sternkriege: (which is German for “Star Wars”) The Random Order (which is a re-ordering of "The First Order")”.<p>
