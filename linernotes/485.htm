What are orchestral favorites? I was in Atlanta taking a tour of the Margaret Mitchell house. She is the author of “Gone with the Wind”. In the gift shop, I opened up a page at random in the book that made her famous. So far I had only met soulless zombies walking in the streets of contemporary downtown Atlanta which is undergoing rapid new construction to house them. It was a dead American city, devoid of any spirits. In the middle of the random page I read: “Two of the black bucks were equipped with banjo and harmonica and they were rendering a spirited version of “If You Want to Have a Good Time, Jine the Cavalry.”” The only black bucks that I met were a homeless dude, in the middle of the night in front of a ‘Bank of America’ building, and the waiter at the German restaurant, ‘Der Biergarten’.  Later that night at the hotel I had a psychotic episode and took Xanax. As a German, I surely cannot get along with beer. That is too bad because in 1921 Arnold Schoenberg told his pupil Josef Rufer, "Today I have discovered something which will assure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years." But Schoenberg moved later to Los Angeles and got his American citizenship. I never made it that far. Except for assuring the supremacy of German music. In LA. That is what ‘Gone with the Mighty Wind’ is all about, that is where it’s happening.
