<P CLASS="style2c"><STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG>'s <EM>FB01 </EM>is a complex and fluid choreography of sonic movements through digital space. Unique, yet connected to the tradition of early electronic music, <EM>FB01</EM> combines the Cologne WDR studios in the <EM>1950</EM>'s, and the Hollywood Science Fiction soundtracks from the <EM>1960</EM>'s, but all re-imagined through pure mathematics with a pleasing sleight of &quot;head music&quot;. Over <EM>6</EM> aptly titled tracks and <EM>7</EM> nanomusic interludes, psycho-cybernetic sounds speaker-pan in hazily melodic and nebulous shapes like transcendental audio that is experienced <EM>through</EM> the listener. </P>
<p CLASS="style2c"><STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG>'s <EM>FB01</EM> supermodernizes the obscure realms of <EM> &quot;</EM>elektronische Musik&quot; for the <EM>21</EM>st century, notably the <EM>Forbidden Planet</EM> soundtrack of<STRONG> Carlos & Bebe Barron</STRONG>, <STRONG>Vladimir Ussachevsky</STRONG>'s <EM>Metamorphosis</EM>, and the electronic serialism of <STRONG>Herbert Eimert</STRONG>'s<EM> Glockenspiel </EM>and <STRONG>Franco Evangelisti</STRONG>'s <EM>Incontri di fasce sonore</EM>. Like <STRONG>Raymond Scott</STRONG>'s  modifications of a Theremin, which led to his 'CLAVIVOX' synthesizer, <STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG> takes an enigmatic keyboard-less sound module (the Yamaha FB-<EM>01</EM>) as the basis for a 'Intuitive Future Oriented Retrograde Motion Music' (IFORMM). </p>
<p CLASS="style2c"><STRONG>rothkamm</STRONG>'s <EM>FB01</EM></SPAN> was recorded between <EM>2002</EM> and <EM>2004</EM> in Hollywood with the miracle of stereophonic sound to make full use of the left, right and phantom channels, and is now available  as a limited-edition concept <STRONG>CD</STRONG> with heady manifesto.</p>
