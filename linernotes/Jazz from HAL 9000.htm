Long before <i>Lady Gaga</i> bought his house, Mr. <i>Zappa</i> ("just another <i>Frank</i> from LA") opinionated in an interview: "If you want to be a musician, you just have to realize that nobody is gonna care." To prove him right, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences gave <i>Frank Zappa</i> a "Best Rock Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist)" Grammy for his "<b>Jazz from Hell</b>" record that was "performed" without any musicians or instruments on a computer, except for the track of "St. Etienne". To be sold in stores "<b>Jazz from Hell</b>" had to carry a sticker that read: "Parental Advisory Explicit Content" and the "Explicit Content" was neither Rock nor Jazz, but his own brand of complex music made on the $200,000 <i>Synclavier</i>.

Even more expensive was the <i>HAL 9000</i>, a sentient computer that controlled the systems of the "Discovery One" spacecraft and interacted with the ship's astronaut crew in both the film and novel entitled "2001: A Space Odyssey", and was mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red dot. As <i>Arthur C. Clarke</i> opinionated in "The Lost Worlds of 2001":  "As is clearly stated in the novel (Chapter 16), <i>HAL</i> stands for <i>H</i>euristically programmed <i>AL</i>gorithmic computer. However, about once a week [sic!] some character spots the fact that HAL is one letter ahead of IBM, and promptly assumes that <i>Stanley</i> [Kubrick] and I were taking a crack at the estimable institution." He was quite the character.

These are the facts. "The world is the totality of facts, not of things", as <i>Ludwig Wittgenstein</i> opinionated. As a matter of fact, I'm going to be <i>frank</i>; this is what "<b>Jazz from HAL 9000</b>" is: Just another very laborious <i>Wiener</i> Process that produced 12 endless streams of complex music, fit for a vinyl record. This ain't no "Jazz for the Jet Set". Quite Zappa-esque? No, Rothkamm-atic! But is anyone gonna care?
