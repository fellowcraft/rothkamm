Dear Wilus'!<br>
<br> 
Thanks for remembering me; but on the other hand I am 
annoyed with you, that you are such a mean and horrid etcetera 
and only write such a scrap to me. Were you short of paper 
or pens, or did you grudge the ink? Perhaps you had no time 
to do more than put in a scrawl? Eh, eh, that's it; you go 
horseback riding, enjoying yourself, and forget about me — 
Well, well; <i>give me a kiss and I'll forgive you.</i><br>
<br>  
<b>I'm glad you're well and jolly, because that's what is wanted 
in the country.</b> I'm so glad I can write to you. I also am enjoying myself; and you're not the only one that rides, for I can 
stick on too. Don't ask how well; but I can, enough for the 
horse to go slowly wherever he prefers, while I sit fearfully 
on his back; like a monkey on a bear. Till now I haven't had 
any falls because the horse hasn't thrown me off ; but — if ever 
he should want me to tumble off, I may do it some day.<br>  
<br> 
<b>I won't bother you with my affairs, because I know they 
won't interest you.</b> The flies often alight on my lofty nose, 
but that's unimportant, because it's rather a custom of these
importunate beasties. The gnats bite me ; but that doesn't matter, 
because it's not on the nose. I run about the garden, and some- 
times walk. I walk in the woods, and sometimes ride, not on 
horseback but in a carriage, or trap, or coach; but with such 
honour that I always sit at the back, never in front. <i>Perhaps I've 
bored you already, but what can I do?</i> If not, then write by 
the first post, and I will continue my epistles at once.<br> 
<br> 
I end my letter therefore without compliments, but amicably. 
Keep well, dear Wilus', and please do write to me. We shall 
meet in 4 weeks. I embrace you heartily. Your sincere friend.<br>
