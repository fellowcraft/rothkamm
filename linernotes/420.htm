The Rosetta Stone is named after the town Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta of Egypt. It was one of many other stones that once made up Fort Julien which is located near Rosetta, our ancient Rashid. I asked Google for directions, but it replied "Sorry, we could not calculate directions from "Home" to "Rasheed, Markaz Rasheed, El Beheira Governorate, Egypt". Who is we, I wondered? The Rosetta Stone is now housed in the British Museum in London, United Kingdom. Google calculated that it would take me 10 hours and 15 minutes by plane, nonstop. As I just got a new Toshiba Chromebook, I unplugged it and it displayed in the taskbar: "Calculating... 100% 8:02", which leaves me with over 2 hours of downtime, if I were to take this flight now and have the laptop calculate this or that for over 8 hours. What do I do for these 2 hours? I could order a meal, I guess, maybe one of these fancy British sandwiches with sheep's milk cheese and pickle relish. If they have that. If not I'd take the chicken sandwich, they always have some chicken this or that. I wonder why? In the Al-Qur'an at 5:3: "Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah." So that is why chicken is OK, but not pulled pork sandwiches. Pigs are very intelligent animals. According to NBC news "Pigs were trained to move a cursor on a video screen with their snouts and used the cursor to distinguish between scribbles they knew and those they were seeing for the first time. They learned the task as quickly as chimpanzees." So, it could have been a pig that re-discovered the Rosetta Stone in 1799, because it really does have 3 different scribbles on it. However, the discovery was made by Pierre Bouchard, who was not an animal. He landed in Egypt on the Fourth of July after the capture of Alexandria and was then made a member of the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, attached to a group of mechanical artists and ordered to investigate Egyptian crafts and techniques. I wonder if all artists are mechanical at this point? Mozart supposedly died from an undercooked pork chop.
