| ROTHKAMM - born 1965 in Gütersloh, Germany. Lives and works in 
| New York City. His encyclopedic work is connected to a matrix of 
| electronic music, conceptual art, supermodern architecture, 
| transcendental idealism and digital media. It probes notions of the
| hidden within the dialectics of commercial and underground culture,
| an extended music concept that critically shape-shifts the role of 
| the composer in society and gives testament to both a utopian future
| and a forgotten past. [ http://rothkamm.com?bio ]
