<p><strong>FB04</strong> <em>- Old New York</em> still exists as a metaphor to those who believe in a city. Because New York is always new, there really is no Old York. It disappeared centuries ago from those that gave it life in the first place: the First Peoples. <br />
  <br />
  <em>Old New York</em> is a phantasmagoria of the living to imagine a reality that no longer is. It is no more and no less than “<em>Ahnenkult</em>” (ancestor worship) that has existed since the first people were first. Wherever New Yorkers go, there has always been somebody before them and somebody always seems to follow in their footsteps. <br />
  <br />
  The New Yorker is never alone. <br />
  <br />
  By the same token, New York is never  united. It is a divided fantasy of all who walk in the city. One is both the city and the self. There they are, always two walking in pairs, but only one carries the burden of proof. So the old is the new, mirrored in time because the opposite is true as well: the new is the old, but time separates them. <br />
  <br />
  This mirror is what makes <em>Old New York</em>. <br />
  <br />
  One could play devil’s advocate and argue that there really is only the one and the rest is done with mirrors. It is only the one, the self, that perpetuates itself from old to new in reflections that fold back onto themselves. But this is no longer true, if it were, the self would always be the center, like the sun king, who looked at the mirror and said “<em>L’etat c'est moi</em>” (I am the state). <br />
  <br />
  In New York there is two of everything, oftentimes side by side, never affirming or contradicting each other.  So New Yorkers are never king but always consul, the co-emperors of the world.</p>
