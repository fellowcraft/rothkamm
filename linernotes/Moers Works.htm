<p align="center"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<P>&quot;Frank Rothkamm is the one of most interesting musicians of today, contemporary of <strong>industrial</strong> culture. He is a true <strong>underground</strong> figure, the fighter of <em>invisible</em> front, who realized a number of projects, produced great records for his own Flux Records label. Being a professionally trained musician, he was shifting freely from tape collages in his teens, and going through different forms including chamber music and pop arrangements. &quot;Moers Works&quot; is his <strong>first experiment</strong>, discovered and unearthed  by me incidentally. Archive materials recorded back in 1982-84 and released after quarter of century!&quot; </P>

<P align="center"><strong>Biographical Notes </strong></P>
<p >It was in the Southern  German town of N&uuml;rtingen where Frank &quot;boy genius&quot; Rothkamm, after  receiving his first piano lessons in his birthplace of G&uuml;tersloh, started  composing music for pianos at the age of <strong>12.</strong> Not satisfied with the timbre  limitations and inability to notate music directly to a recording medium, he  set out to design his own electronic music system. It was not until <strong>1982</strong> in the  town of Moers, when Rothkamm was <strong>16</strong>, that this dream was finally realized.</p>
<p > The  system consisted solely of a turntable, a shortwave radio, a phaser, an EQ, a  cassette recorder and an UHER reel-to-reel tape recorder. To accommodate this  setup of rather moderate means he devised the method of irreversible additive  overdubbing of monophonic tracks with stereophony achieved with tape delay. </p>

<p >All  tracks on this CD were recorded with this completely analog  &quot;sampling&quot; system which incorporated a borrowed Korg MS-<strong>20</strong>  synthesizer in Tracks <strong>2</strong> and <strong>10</strong>. In Track <strong>7</strong> the base samples of guitar, piano,  strings were recorded at the studio of the local Castle Theatre, where he  trained as an actor. </p>
<p >Rothkamm perceived his compositional technique to be very  &quot;digital&quot;; informed by both Punk Rock with its sudden shifts and hard  cuts, and by the mathematics of permutation. All Moers Works were composed to  be used in a live performance, and it was in these works where he developed his  first piece that takes place in unusual locations. Track <strong>3</strong> was recorded during  a <strong>1</strong> week experiment where he would live and work at night and sleep during the  day. Track <strong>7</strong> was commissioned by the theatre and forms the overture to the  Heiner Mueller play of the same name, commencing with a stone thrown through a  window. Tracks <strong>4</strong> through <strong>6</strong> were part of his ambitious &quot;Fisch II&quot;  series, first performed in <strong>1984</strong> in the <strong>25</strong>-seat Pulverhaus, a <strong>16</strong>th century  ammunition powder storage building located in the park. This brought him  publicity that he has never regained since<strong>.</strong></p>
