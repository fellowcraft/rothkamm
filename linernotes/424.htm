Midtown Manhattan is below Central Park but above the Flatiron Building. I don’t want to name drop here, but a lot of people were there. Some still are. What happens in Midtown Manhattan in the middle of the night? Well, we know now. Does anybody just go to Midtown Manhattan and listen to what’s really going on after dark, between midnight and the crack of dawn? Well, they do now. The truth is 7 hours and 27 minutes long and it is undeniably the longest composition I’ve put in front of the American people. To form a more perfect union? To be all you can be? To keep it short, yes. This is the New World. To understand the New World you have to listen to it. Not forever, but for a long time. Don’t sleep through it. Comprehension is a form of endurance.
