<p>“Życie seksualne dzikich” is the original Polish title of Bronisław Malinowski`s “Sexual Life of Savages”, a classic book of anthropology published in 1929. To be exact, the complete title amounts to “The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia“ which refers to a group of islands in a subregion of Oceania. Most Westerners do not discuss their sex lives or have any idea that Melanesia even exits. Malinowski therefore concerns himself with what we consider a “taboo” in a “terra incognita”, something unmentionable that takes place in an unknown country. I am no exception since I have not read the book, but merely have taken its title to describe a musical narrative that deals with my research in San Francisco and New York between 1993 and 1994. My savages are American and not Melanesian -- although many Melanesians live in San Francisco and New York now. Unlike Malinowski I am not Polish but German, however my ancestors came from former German territories that now part of Lithuania. What unfolds here over the course of 35 minutes and 30 seconds is best thought of - structurally - as 6 busy post-structural dances with a happy ending spread over the 2 sides of a vinyl record. The scope here is narrow. Think of it as a form of Rock or Pop entertainment that takes you to a place you have never heard of and - if you are a Westerner and the volume is cranked up to 11 - you’ll experience something you would never discuss with your parents. Just like politics or religion. Or sex.</p>
