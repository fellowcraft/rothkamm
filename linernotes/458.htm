<!--To disambiguate ‘Us and Them’, we shall ask Roger Waters, creative force of the rocking combo Pink Floyd and now mixer of music and politics. He gave this opinion piece in November of 2016 to NPR:  "I was listening to ‘Us and Them’ the other day. There's a line which goes, 'With, without, and who'll deny that's what the fighting's all about?' And the answer to the question is this: Almost everyone. Almost everyone will deny that 'with/without' is what the fighting's all about. My contention is that it is. That's why my new tour is going to be called 'Us and Them.'” 
However, in a decades older interview, while impersonating the film director Antonioni, Waters gave this opinion: "It's beautiful, but is it too sad, you know? It makes me think of church". The original ‘Us and Them’ was written by the late keyboard player of Pink Floyd, Richard Wright, for the Antonioni directed film ‘Zabriskie Point’ and was titled ‘The Violent Sequence’. It had no lyrics and the year was 1969. But Antonioni rejected it, apparently on the grounds just cited. It wasn’t until the 1972 performance version of the song that featured vocals and we all had to wait for the official Waters’ penned lyrics with the release of the album ‘Dark Side of the Moon’. So be carefull with that axe you put to history here, Roger. Because there are the 99% of us who haved lived without world tours, saxophones, opinions of roadies and/or tape delays. Their only consequential interviews were with border agents. They spent the decades reading rejection letters and holding down jobs. They got constantly for an answer “You are…?”, “Do you have any money?”, “No, not really what we’re looking for” or “The check’s in the mail”, which it never was. They will think of ‘Us and Them’ much differently, twice as long and twice as hard.-->
