<P>It is a historical fact that in 1967 Australian Prime Minister Holt dived into the ocean off a beach near Melbourne and   vanished without a trace. </P>
<P>It has been speculated that he did not drown but was   initiated into the <strong>Grand Lodge Of The Deep</strong> while under water.   It is said that this legendary Lodge still presides in an   underwater geodesic dome, occasionally mistaken for <em>Atlantis</em>. Although not much is known about the Lodge's rites, communication took place that enabled me to receive the recordings found on this disc.<br />
  <br />
  The <strong>Mystery of the Leaping Fish</strong> dates back far in time, before, one is inclined to say, there was time at all. I have therefore faithfully mastered these sound manifestations to the standards set in the <em>Mmakthor Alchemie</em>.<br />
  <br /> 
  It is clear while listening that much remains unexplained. Here I can only testify to the authentic ritual nature of these recordings, drawn from personal experience about secrets revealed to me recently.</P>
