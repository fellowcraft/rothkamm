<p>In an episode of the TV show "Hart to Hart", Jonathan suffers from temporary amnesia. Although he is "a self-made millionaire" and "married to a woman who can take care of herself", none of that matters now because he can't remember anything or anyone, just bits and pieces of a crime he witnessed. When the couple have a romantic dinner in the courtyard of their wonderful Southern California home, he puts his head into his hands and mutters "I don't know anything". Jennifer then takes him into her arms and assures him: "I love you and that's all you'll ever have to remember." It is for tender moments such as these that this album "Lovers under the Moonlight" is made, perhaps only because it seems that the composer here also suffers from memory confusion because all the pieces sound a lot like pieces from other composers like Czerny or Mozart. As if transformed by moonlight, they seem to be just slowed down or transposed to fit the mood. Some even appear to be just made up on the spot to hide the fact that the composer can't remember what he wanted to play. In others we find him tuning the piano while he plays. We can't even be sure if he plays or if some kind of computer algorithm has been used to produce the score. But does all this meta-musical questioning of "authorship" and "method" really matter? In our hearts we know the source where all music comes from, so even if we do not know anything, we only have to remember that we love and are loved, that we are "Lovers under the Moonlight".</p>
