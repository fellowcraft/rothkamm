In the ancient Americas the habanero chili came from the Amazon region. An intact fruit of a small domesticated habanero, found in pre-ceramic levels in Guitarrero Cave in the Peruvian highlands, was dated to 6500 BC. Habanero chilis are extremely hot, rated 100,000–350,000 on the Scoville scale. What can it do for you, today? In the “El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)" episode of the animated TV series “The Simpsons”, Homer hallucinates and find his "Space Coyote", voiced by Johnny Cash. Yes, that is possible with powerful peppers in the Americas. At least on TV. Here at home in LA, the hottest things can be on TV. As I do not do hot entertainment well, I think the most important thing, which is composition, goes well with a Tequila of sorts, also known as the ‘Zappa’. If you subtract his endless noodles on guitar and the all the homophobic songs - in other words you distill it -  you’re not left with much. Except for music that sound like Silvestre Revueltas, the “Mexican Stravinsky”. Of course it is a condescending, eurocentric statement, surely made by someone who never had a habanero. Stravinsky lived in LA and watched TV. Hot peppers and tequila were never far away. Not quite sure, if he ever had any. After the commercial failure of ‘Porgy and Bess’, George Gershwin moved to LA and to his day I don’t know how he survived without a true New York bagel. It is truly the biggest challenge a composer can face. Instead you only get habaneros and the tequila I christened ‘Zappa’. If you have enough of these, you can hear your Pink Panther. Do you want to go that far? I have the score for you!
