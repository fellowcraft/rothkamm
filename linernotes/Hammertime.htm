<pre align="center">
You can’t touch this. 
Fresh new kicks and pants.
I toured around the world from London to the bank. 
Found nothing but equal temperament. 
How boring is that? 
Has the whole world gone mad?
Piano should have more than 88 keys. 
But they tell me I can’t touch this. 
Instead, get a piano tuner at the ready. 
For each of the ivories and ebonies.  
Tune the note before you hit it. 
Bingo, home run, there you go.
