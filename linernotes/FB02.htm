<p align="center"><strong>The 2nd Album of the FB01-Machine-Trilogy</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>***</strong></p>
<P >Having laid the cornerstone for sci-fi serialism with his early 21st century album &quot;<STRONG><A HREF="http://rothkamm.com/album.cfm?FB01">FB01</A></STRONG>&quot;, ROTHKAMM returns after 3 years of labor with &quot;<STRONG>FB02</STRONG>&quot;, a <EM>space drama</EM> of Intuitive Future Oriented Retrograde Motion Music (<a href="http://iformm.com">IFORMM</a>).<BR />
  <BR />
&quot;<STRONG>FB02 - Astronaut of Inner Space</STRONG>&quot; is a feast for the mind and the ears of anyone interested in the ancient past and utopian future of electronic music as this album manages the dialectic <EM>coup d'&eacute;tat</EM> of greatest accessibility AND infinite complexity. The former is achieved with traces of other-, or shall we say, inner-worldly microtonal melodies and the later through the meticulously researched psycho-cybernetic sound architectures that appear to obey the laws of a parallel universe.<BR />
<p>ROTHKAMM premiered the work on Thursday, June 29, 2006 at exactly 9:04 PM on a Manhattan rooftop stage as a 3D view &amp; sound TRIPHONY. Now, with this special CD kit designed for home use, YOU can replicate the experience!<BR />

<!--
<p><strong>The Audio Effect</strong></p>
<P >Playback of the ROTHKAMM <strong>&quot;FB02</strong>&quot; Compact Disc is fully compatible with a regular stereo setup, but
to experience the TRIPHONY audio effect you will need to re-arrange the speakers of a home theatre
or computer speaker system. <br />
<br />
Audio on FB02 is encoded as a regular stereo image that decodes on a 4.1
channel system. Alternately, a 2.1 system with two additional speakers or a 5.1 system can be used. <br />
<br />
The
speakers are usually labeled Left Front, Right Front, Left Back (or Surround), Right Back (or Surround),
and Sub(woofer). Arrange the Left Front and Right Front speaker so they almost touch and place them
at a distance in front of you. The speakers should be elevated to ear level.Take the Sub-woofer and place
it on the ground at half the distance between you and the front speakers. Now take the Left Back and
Right Back and place them (elevated to ear level) at a distance to the left and right, so that you are almost
between the speakers. Make sure that the same sound and volume level is on all Left speakers and all
Right speakers, respectively.<br />
<br /> 
If you were to connect all speakers with straight lines you would see a tetrahedron,
a 3-sided pyramid upside down.</P>
