<p>In  Manhattan, on the Upper East Side, in the city  of New York, a  Steinway &amp; Sons Model M grand piano sits on the fifth floor of Zahra&rsquo;s  apartment. The piano has been completely rebuilt since its 1934 birthday. </p>
<p align="center"><em>The  realm of the shadows is the paradise for dreamers. <br />
  Here  they find a country without limits,<br />
  Where  they can continue to build as they please.</em>*</p>
<p>I  first contacted Zahra when I was in New    York living alone, without a keyboard or any type of  musical instrument. I wanted to play the piano, but not at the Steinway  showroom. She generously opened her home and fallboard. I brought my  microphones, but no score. Putting Plato's theory on memory to test in the  manner of a utopian-scientific experiment, I simply remembered, from eternal  ideas, fugues that are intimate, pretty, and free like birds. </p>
<p>The  fugues, for 4 independent monophonic voices realized by an 8-armed pianist, fly  around the very definition of a fugue through the baroque concept of pure ornamentation  vs. <em>cantus firmus</em> (fixed song). Independent  from each other, like Leibniz' <em>monads, </em>the  4 voices' <em>tempi</em> micro-fluctuate around  linear time and macro-oscillate stylistically through the centuries around  historical time. </p>
<p>To  enhance the sound effect for the listener, a matched pair of microphones was  set up so that they form a perfect triangle above the strings. I call this <em>Platonischer  Kunstkopf </em>(Platonic art head) and it is thusly defined: A ORTF  configuration developed by the <em>Office de Radiodiffusion T&eacute;l&eacute;vision Fran&ccedil;aise </em>in which a pair of cardioid microphones are angled apart at 110 degrees  with 6.69 inches between the capsules - the average distance between human ears  - now altered to the <em>Blumlein</em> pair angled at 90 degrees with the  distance between capsules altered to the <em>Rothkamm</em> distance between the  ears. </p>
<p>This  release is my first non-electronic, all acoustic work in twenty-five years. </p>
<p>To  me, Zahra will always mean &quot;White, Radiant&quot;. </p>
<p align="center"><em>Thence  originated the present piano music, <br />
  Which,  we flatter ourselves, <br />
  Will  fully satisfy the listener; <br />
  For  the main part he will not understand,<br />
  Another  part he will not believe,<br />
  And  the rest he will laugh at.</em>*<br />
