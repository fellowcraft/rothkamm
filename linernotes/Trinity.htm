<p>Trinity is the culmination of decades of reflection since my few days as a teenage postulant at the Cistercian monastery in Lilienfeld, Austria. The album has 3 distinct compositional approaches: Firstly, it is played on a keyboard via spirit communication (intuitive); secondly, it is exclusively computed through a single algorithm (analytic); and thirdly, it is twiddled on an analog synthesizer (synthetic). Trinity provides the much sought-after answers to the question: How are transubstantiation, spiritism &  psychostochastics possible?.</p>
