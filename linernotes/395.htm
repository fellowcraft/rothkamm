The term Triassic originated in 1834 with Friedrich von Alberti. HIs nomenclature was based on three distinct rock layers that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europe. As a geological time period, the Triassic started around 252 millions years ago in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, which left the Earth's biosphere impoverished. Any life not located in the ocean was then concentrated on the vast supercontinent of Pangaea. The late Triassic marks the breakup of Pangaea which first separated New Jersey from Morocco. Here at the Lodge For Utopian Science it is easy for us to travel back in time via remote viewing, so to reconstruct the music from that period was merely a matter of combining New Jersey style (think of Max Mathews and his invention of the Music-X languages, Milton Babbitt or early James Tenney) and Moroccan Sufi brotherhoods (tarikas) style, whose music is an attempt at reaching a trance state which inspires mystical ecstasy. These traditions, separated at birth, are now united again in this song of the ‘Triassic Birds’. The algorithm of our song dates from 1240 from a manual titled Carmen de Algorismo composed by Alexandre de Villedieu. It begins thus: “Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.” which translates as: “Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.” This is of course Ten, our Pythagorean Decad or as Flavius Aetius described it in the 5th century A.D.:  “Ten is the very nature of number. All Greeks and all barbarians alike count up to ten, and having reached ten revert again to the unity.” An algorithm in the computer language Python begets a program that begets a computer language Csound program, which renders a Microsoft WAV file. This contains all the Pangaean secrets. There are of course those that claim that the “Wiener Process”, first revealed to the public by the Paris-based record label Baskaru in 2015, already contains everything you need to unlock the mysteries of each day in your life. Don’t be fooled. A review on the blackaudio fake music review site already debunked this so-called ‘Wiener Process’ with these words: “You will hear nothing but different pitches of hisses and whirs that will drive you insane”. On the other hand and in conclusion, ‘Triassic Birds’, the ‘Chymische Hochzeit’ or Rosicrucian marriage of New Jersey-style American computer music (yes, Albert Einstein lived in New Jersey) and Moroccan trance music in the Sufi tradition (yes, Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya was a Sufi) will finally bring much needed sanity to this world.
