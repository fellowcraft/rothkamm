My Life in Xanadu was brief. So brief in fact, that someone could question it ever happened. Well, it did. Here it is. If this isn’t proof enough. Someone will always question the obvious and state that there really is no life in Xanadu and therefore there really is nothing. But even nothing is something as we have learned. There just isn’t an obvious false positive anymore. Something seems always indicative of something else, except nothing. Nothing leads to nothing. Like in medieval logic. Creatio ex nihilo. That’s Latin for “creation out of nothing”. How can this be? How can there be anything if there is really nothing, everywhere and every time? Let’s say nothing is 0. No matter how many arithmetical operations I perform on 0, I end up with 0, if I only have 0, which is nothing. 0 + 0 = 0. 0 - 0 = 0. 0 * 0 = 0. 0 / 0 = undefined. Ha, now we’re getting somewhere: You cannot divide by Zero. So, my life in Xanadu was brief because it lasted only as long as I divided by Zero, which created something out of nothing until I realized that outside of Xanadu, all of this has no meaning and is undefined. I start with nothing and I end up with nothing. That’s something, isn’t it?
