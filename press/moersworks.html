>Frank Rothkamm is the one of most interesting musicians of today, contemporary of <strong>industrial</strong> culture. He is a true <strong>underground</strong> figure, the fighter of <em>invisible front</em>, who realized a number of projects, produced great records for his own Flux Records label. Being a professionally trained musician, he was shifting freely from tape collages in his teens, and going through different forms including chamber music and pop arrangements. &quot;Moers Works&quot; is his <strong>first experiment</strong>, discovered and unearthed by me incidentally. Archive materials recorded back in <strong>1982-84</strong> and released after quarter of century! </span

          <p class="style2">It was in the Southern German town of N&uuml;rtingen  where Frank &quot;boy genius&quot; Rothkamm, after receiving his first piano  lessons in his home town of G&uuml;tersloh, started composing music for pianos at  the age of <strong>12</strong>. Not satisfied with the timbre limitations and inability to  notate music directly to a recording medium, he set out to design his own <em>electronic music system</em>. It was not until <strong>1982</strong> in the town of Moers, when Frank  was <strong>16</strong>, that this dream was finally realized. </p>
          <p class="style1"><span class="style2">The <em>system</em> consisted solely of a turntable, a shortwave radio, a phaser, an EQ, a  cassette recorder and an UHER reel-to-reel tape recorder. To accommodate this  setup of rather moderate means he devised the method of irreversible additive  overdubbing of monophonic tracks with stereophony achieved with tape delay.</span></p></td>

In Track <strong>07</strong>, the base samples of  guitar, piano, and strings were recorded at the studio of the local Castle  Theatre, where he trained as an actor. Rothkamm perceived his compositional  technique to be very &quot;digital&quot;; informed by both Punk Rock with its  sudden shifts and hard cuts, and by the mathematics of permutation</span>.<br><br>
<img src="http://rothkamm.com/image/rothkammMoers1984.jpg" width="100" height="101" hspace="10" border="0" align="left"><span class="style2">All Moers Works were composed to be used in live  performance, and it was in these works where he developed his first piece that  took place in an unusual location. Track <strong>03</strong> was recorded during a <strong>1</strong> week  experiment where he would live and work at night and sleep during the day.  Track <strong>07</strong> was commissioned by the theatre and forms the overture to the Heiner  Mueller play of the same name, commencing with a stone thrown through a window.  Tracks <strong>04</strong> through <strong>06</strong> were part of his ambitious &quot;Fisch <strong>II</strong>&quot; series,  first performed in <strong>1984</strong> in the <strong>25</strong>-seat Pulverhaus, a <strong>16</strong>th century ammunition  powder storage building located in the park. This brought him publicity that he  has never regained since. </span></p>
