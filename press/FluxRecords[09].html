<p class="style1">http://rothkamm.com has been built to house my post-summer 2002 work under the new label 
  and anti-pseudonym "rothkamm". Its primary purpose is to pave the way for the introduction 
  of my new Compact Disc Album "FB01".  </p>
<p class="style1"> http://rothkamm.com introduces the concept of supermodern web architecture (SWA).</p>
<p class="style1"> Like a model home from the Case Study Houses of 1945 through 1962, SWA intends 
  "to inspire the building of low-cost modern homes in America"[1] but this home does not exist 
  in the physical space of architecture; rather it exists in the space and time 
  of electronic information.  </p>
<p class="style1">It appears as a condition of experience that both time and space exist[2], however 
  the very categories of time and space are no longer those we traditionally associate 
  with physicality.  </p>
<p class="style1">http://rothkamm.com is a self-replicating, clone-able home site and is literally served from home, 
  a true "extension of man"[3].  </p>
<p class="style1">I am the server. Unlike other constructions of identity and brand, rothkamm refers only 
  to itself by itself. Architecture and content describe each other.  </p>
<p class="style1">http://rothkamm.com has two spheres: protected and public. The public (or anonymous) sphere 
  is made up of 2 parts: shopping and radio. The protected (or secret) sphere is made up of 
  2+n parts: potentially indefinite subsections below the public surface where you can add to 
  what is I, rothkamm.  </p>
