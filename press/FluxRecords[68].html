                  my 15th <em>album</em> in the Flux Records Digital series of sound, image, &amp; text (FLX32).<BR>

<p>This is a binaural record of six hours and forty-five minutes. It was made on the Fourth of July in the year two thousand and fourteen Anno Domini in the United States of America. Two matched microphones were placed in a window of a room in a single family home in Lakewood, Colorado, facing the magnetic North Pole. The distance between the two matched microphones was equal to the distance between the two ears of a human head. Therefore, a pair of full-frequency headphones is required to hear the "Fourth of July" as a binaural record. The playback volume should be adjusted to the sweet spot where the environment of the listener and the record blend and become so natural that the listener shouldn't be able to distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>The composer of this record was not present during the full six hours and forty-five minutes. The score specified that he was to be absent and, under no circumstances, interfere with the chain of events that unfolded. Thus, the recording took place without any life form being aware of the fact. It is action at a distance. The music of opus 542 takes place solely in the mind of the listener. It turns the listener into the creator.</p> 

<p>Many thanks go to the Schneider family for their generous support to make this great work possible.</p>
