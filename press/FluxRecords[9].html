Dear #ucase(left(Trim(email),Find('@',Trim(email))-1))#

I would like to personally invite you to the release of:

===================
http://rothkamm.com
===================

featuring:	
o 24/7 radio station 
o new manifesto 
o new "name dropping" biography
o new photos
o real-time project list with blogs
o multi-lingual machine translation
+ a fabulous shopping mall			

http://rothkamm.com has been built to house my post-summer 2002 work under the new label and anti-pseudonym "rothkamm". Its primary purpose is to pave the way for the introduction of my new Compact Disc Album "FB01". 

http://rothkamm.com introduces the concept of supermodern web architecture (SWA). Like a model home from the Case Study Houses of 1945 through 1962, SWA intends "to inspire the building of low-cost modern homes in America"[1] but this home does not exist in the physical space of architecture; rather it exists in the space and time of electronic information. It appears as a condition of experience that both time and space exist[2], however the very categories of time and space are no longer those we traditionally associate with physicality. 

http://rothkamm.com is a self-replicating, clone-able home site and is literally served from home, a true "extension of man"[3]. I am the server. Unlike other constructions of identity and brand, rothkamm refers only to itself by itself. Architecture and content describe each other.

http://rothkamm.com has two spheres: protected and public. The public (or anonymous) sphere is made up of 2 parts: shopping and radio. The protected (or secret) sphere is made up of 2+n parts: potentially indefinite subsections below the public surface where you can add to what is I, rothkamm.
