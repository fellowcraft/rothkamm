<p>It was in the year 1995 A.D. when the 30 year old German composer Frank Rothkamm managed to avoid the attention of US law enforcement officials by adopting the modest disguise and name of Frank Genius. Thusly anglicized he continued to live in extremely modest housing in the New York City borough of Brooklyn amongst Dominicans, Hasidic Jews and Italians. Unwisely, he followed in the footsteps of another present day composer who refused to die, namely Frank Zappa who thought of cigarettes as a proper form of nourishment. This only left him scraping for change in his battered jeans at the end of each month. It is also true that he walked 3 miles - snow or shine - from his apartment to visit the magical 99 cents store, where 3 cans of beans - mind you any kind, from black to pinto - could be obtained for a mere 99 cents. His favorite meal became beans and rice, a complete protein. Fortunately, through the sale of a few One Minute Wonders two years prior, he owned a modest but state-of-the-art computer music workstation centered around a Kurzweil K2000. Always striving to make his disguise appear genuine, Frank took the L-train to Soho and sought to learn everything from a real genius of music, producer Peter Scherer. When he returned home to Brooklyn, he got busy.</p>

<p>Frank lived in a future that was the supermodern reality between humans and machines. The reality around him became increasingly machine generated. The body of the world became unstructured data. The human voice was the only remaining non-interchangeable part. The voice became the Last of the Mohicans in the world of data: The sample of the voice surrounded by complete synthesis.</p>

<p>Where did these voices come from? From your local library, of course, more specifically from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts` vinyl record collection. From the Simpsons on TV. From Harald Fuchs` personal account of his explorations to the origin of Man in Africa. And from a miraculous voice belonging to a singer from the Swiss mountains: Corin Curschellas. She commissioned Frank to take a sample from each song of her album "Rappa Nomad" and to compose the centerpiece of this album, opus 247 “Curschellas Woke”.</p>

<p>So there is a story and a narrative to the “Miraculous Works of Frank Genius in Brooklyn”, a large world of synthesis around bits of voices. The trip here has faint echoes from the last “Storm Rave” Frank attended and from his teenage cult record, Steve Hillage`s “Fish Rising”. But, within a framework of techno, there are structures of Indian and African music, there are poly-rhythms and poly-harmony, there are unpredictable breakdowns, and above all there is VAST (Variable Architecture Synthesis). Seriously, could this even be a parody of the dying acid house counterculture?</p>

<p>So, without further ado, here, in order of appearance in this motion picture for your ears, are the "Miraculous Works of Frank Genius in Brooklyn” featuring the small human snippets of Patrick Stewart (as “Number One” of the Stonecutters), Herbert Eimert, Carol King, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Padmini Rao, Frank Rothkamm (Inhaling), Ringo Starr, Corin Curschellas (from “Rappa Nomad”), John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney’s laughter, and last, but not least, a Bounkam Solo (from Nonesuch “Music of West Africa”).</p>
