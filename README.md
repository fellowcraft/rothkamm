LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack artwork media server: MP3 JPEG PDF TXT HTML

This (rothkamm cloud) artwork media server is device agnostic and scales from large projections to smart phones. 

The work is organized into many units where the central nexus is represented in an “Album”, in the code base here this is the album.php file. The code itself (all written with VIM) is part of the artwork and should (eventually) be pretty.

The historical reference here are the vinyl records and Compact Discs of the 20th century, due to my history in releasing cassettes, records and CDs from 1986-2014.

However these rothkamm cloud albums are independent of their physical models and strive to present a 21st century art projection. 

This in itself is steeped in the history of the “server” paradigm of the early 21st century and its “client” model: The client “selects” media that will be “streamed”. 

The artwork is then the unity of its media: Sound (MP3), Image (JPEG) & Text (PDF, TXT, HMTL).
