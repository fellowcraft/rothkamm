LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) stack artwork media cloud: MP3 JPEG PDF TXT/HTML

This rothkamm artwork media cloud (http://rothkamm.com) is device agnostic and scales from large projections to smart phones. 

The work is organized into many units where the central nexus is represented in an “Album” which is made up of "Tracks". The main selecting nexus is “Albums”, the albums.php file. The php code itself (all written with VIM) is part of the artwork.

The historical reference here are the cassettes, vinyl records and Compact Discs of the 20th century, due to my history in releasing cassettes, records and CDs from 1986-2015.

However these rothkamm cloud albums are independent of their physical models and strive to present a 21st century art projection. 

This in itself is steeped in the history of the “server” paradigm of the early 21st century and its “client” model: The client “selects” media that will be “streamed”. 

The artwork is then the unity of its media: Sound (MP3), Image (JPEG) & Text (PDF, TXT, HMTL).
